.SH DESCRIPTION
.B @PACKAGE@
reads a single email on standard input, and by default outputs it on
standard output.  If the email is determined to be spam, an additional header
("X-Spam: YES") will be added, and optionally the subject line can have
"[SPAM]" prepended to it.

.B @PACKAGE@
is intended to be used in a
.BR procmail (1)
recipe, in a ruleset such as this:

.RS
 :0 wf
 | @PACKAGE@ -ra
 
 :0 H:
 * X-Spam: YES
 $HOME/mail/spam
.RE

For more examples, including sample
.BR procmail (1)
recipes, see the
.B EXAMPLES
section below.

.SH TRAINING
Before
.B @PACKAGE@
can be used properly, it needs to be trained.  A good way to train
.B @PACKAGE@
is to collect a copy of all your email into two folders - one for spam, and
one for non-spam.  Once you have done this, you can use the training
function, like this:

.RS
 @PACKAGE@ -aT spam-folder non-spam-folder
.RE

This will generate a database that can be used by
.B @PACKAGE@
to guess whether email received in the future is spam or not.
Note that this initial training run may take a long time, but you should
only need to do it once.

To mark a 
.B single message
as
.BR spam ,
pipe it to
.B @PACKAGE@
with the
.BR \-\-mark-spam " or " \-m
("mark as spam") option.  This will update the database accordingly and
discard the email.

To mark a
.B single message
as
.BR non-spam ,
pipe it to
.B @PACKAGE@
with the
.BR \-\-mark-nonspam " or " \-M
("mark as non-spam") option.  Again, this will discard the email.

If a message has been mis-tagged, simply send it to
.B @PACKAGE@
as the opposite type, i.e. if it has been mistakenly tagged as spam, pipe it
into
.B @PACKAGE@ --mark-nonspam --weight=2
to add it to the non-spam side of the database with double the usual
weighting.

.SH OPTIONS
The
.B @PACKAGE@
options are listed below.
.TP
.BI "\-d, \-\-database " [TYPE:]FILE
Use
.I FILE
as the spam/non-spam database.  The default is to use
.B /var/lib/@PACKAGE@db
and, if that is not available or is read-only,
.BR $HOME/.@PACKAGE@db .
This option can also be useful if there is a system-wide database but you do
not want to use it - specifying your own here will override the default.

If you prefix the filename with a
.BR TYPE ,
of the form
.BR btree:$HOME/.@PACKAGE@db ,
then this will specify what kind of database
.B FILE
is, such as
.BR list ", " btree ", " gdbm ", " sqlite
and so on.  Check the output of
.B @PACKAGE@ -V
to see which database backends are available.  The default is to auto-detect
the type, or, if the file does not already exist, use
.BR list .
Note that
.B TYPE
is not case-sensitive.
.TP
.BI "\-g, \-\-global " [TYPE:]FILE
Use
.I FILE
as the default global database, instead of
.BR /var/lib/@PACKAGE@db .
If you also specify a database with
.BR \-d ,
then this "global" database will be used in read-only mode in conjunction
with the read-write database specified with
.BR \-d .
The
.B \-g
option can be used a second time to specify a third database, which will
also be used in read-only mode.
Again, the filename can optionally be prefixed with a
.B TYPE
which specifies the database type.
.TP
.BR "\-P, \-\-plain-map " "FILE"
Maintain a mapping of all database tokens to their non-hashed counterparts in
.IR FILE ,
one token per line.  This can be useful if you want to be able to list the
contents of your database at a later date, for instance to get a list of
email addresses in your allow-list.  Note that using this option may slow
.B @PACKAGE@
down, and only entries written to the database while this option is active
will be stored in
.IR FILE .
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-subject
Rewrite the Subject line of any email that turns out to be spam, adding
"[SPAM]" to the start of the line.
.TP
.BI "\-S, \-\-subject-marker " "SUBJECT"
Instead of adding "[SPAM]", add
.B SUBJECT
to the Subject line of any email that turns out to be spam.  Implies
.BR \-s .
.TP
.BI "\-H, \-\-header-marker " "MARK"
Instead of setting the X-Spam header to "YES", set it to
.B MARK
if email turns out to be spam.  This can be useful if your email client
can only search all headers for a string, rather than one particular header
(so searching for "YES" might match more than just the output of
.BR @PACKAGE@ ).
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-no-header
Do not add an X-Spam header to messages.
.TP
.B \-r, \-\-add-rating
Insert an additional header X-Spam-Rating which is a rating of the
"spamminess" of a message from 0 to 100; 90 and above are counted as spam,
anything under 90 is not considered spam.
If combined with
.BR \-t ,
then the rating (0-100) will be output, on its own, on standard output.
.TP
.B \-A, \-\-asterisk
Insert an additional header X-Spam-Level which will contain between 0 and 20
asterisks (*), depending on the spam rating.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-test
Instead of passing the message out on standard output, output nothing,
and exit 0 if the message is not spam, or exit 1 if the message is spam.
If combined with
.BR \-r ,
then the spam rating will be output on standard output.
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-allowlist
Enable the allow-list.  This causes the email addresses given in the
message's "From:" and "Return-Path:" headers to be checked against a list;
if either one matches, then the message is always treated as non-spam,
regardless of what the token database says. When specified with a retraining
flag,
.B -a -m
(mark as spam) will remove that address from the allow-list as well as
marking the message as spam, and
.B -a -M
(mark as non-spam) will add that address to the allow-list as well as
marking the message as non-spam.  The idea is that you add all of your
friends to the allow-list, and then none of their messages ever get marked
as spam.
.TP
.B \-y, \-\-denylist
Enable the deny-list.  This causes the email addresses given in the
message's "From:" and "Return-Path:" headers to be checked against a second
list; if either one matches, then theh message is always treated as spam.
Training works in the same way as with
.BR \-a ,
except that you must specify
.B -m
or
.B -M
twice to modify the deny-list instead of the allow-list, and with the
reverse syntax:
.B -y -m -m
(mark as spam) will add that address to the deny-list, whereas
.B -y -M -M
(mark as non-spam) will remove that address from the deny-list.
This double specification is so that the usual retraining process never
touches the deny-list; the deny-list should be carefully maintained
rather than automatically generated.

Normally you would not need to use the deny-list.
.TP
.BI "\-L, \-\-level, \-\-threshold " "LEVEL"
Change the spam scoring threshold level which must be reached before an
email is classified as spam.  The default is 90.
.TP
.BI "\-Q, \-\-min-tokens " "NUM"
Only give a score if more than
.B NUM
tokens are found in the message - otherwise the message is assumed to be
non-spam, and it is not modified in any way.  The default is 0.  This option
might be useful if you find that very short messages are being frequently
miscategorised.
.TP
.BI "\-e, \-\-email, \-\-email\-only " "EMAIL"
Query or update the allow-list entry for the email address
.BR EMAIL .
With no other options, this will simply output "YES" if
.B EMAIL
is in the allow-list, or "NO" if it is not. With
.BR \-t ,
it will not output anything, but will exit 0 (success) if
.B EMAIL
is in the allow-list, or 1 (failure) if it is not. With the
.B \-m
(mark-spam) option, any previous allow-list entry for
.B EMAIL
will be removed. Finally, with the
.B \-M
(mark-nonspam) option,
.B EMAIL
will be added to the allow-list if it is not already on it.

If
.B EMAIL
is just the word
.B MSG
on its own, then an email will be read from standard input, and the email
addresses given in the "From:" and "Return-Path:" headers will be used.

Using
.B \-e
automatically switches on
.BR \-a .

If you also specify
.BR \-y ,
then the deny-list will be operated on. Remember that
.B \-m
and
.B \-M
are reversed with the deny-list.

If you specify an email address of the form
.B @domain
(nothing before the @), then the whole
.I domain
will be allow or deny listed.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Add extra
.B X-@UCPACKAGE@-Info
headers to any filtered email, containing error messages and so on if
applicable.  Specify
.B \-v
more than once to increase verbosity.
.TP
.BI "\-T, \-\-train " "SPAM NONSPAM [MAXROUNDS]"
Train the database using the two mbox folders
.B SPAM
and
.BR NONSPAM ,
by testing each message in each folder and updating the database each time
a message is miscategorised.  This is done several times, and may take a
while to run.  Specify the
.B -a
(allow-list) flag to add every sender in the
.B NONSPAM
folder to your allow-list as a side-effect of the training process.
If
.B MAXROUNDS
is specified, training will end after this number of rounds if the results
are still not good enough. The default is a maximum of 200 rounds.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-mark-spam
Instead of passing the message out on standard output, mark its contents as
spam and update the database accordingly.  If the allow-list
.BR "" ( -a )
is enabled, the message's "From:" and "Return-Path:" addresses are removed
from the allow-list.
If the deny-list
.BR "" ( -y )
is enabled and you specify
.B -m
twice, the message's addresses are added to the deny-list instead.
.TP
.B \-M, \-\-mark-nonspam
Instead of passing the message out on standard output, mark its contents as
non-spam and update the database accordingly.  If the allow-list
.BR "" ( -a )
is enabled, the message's "From:" and "Return-Path:" addresses are added to
the allow-list (see the
.B -a
option above).
If the deny-list
.BR "" ( -y )
is enabled and you specify
.B -M
twice, the message's addresses are removed from the deny-list instead.
.TP
.BI "\-w, \-\-weight " WEIGHT
When marking as spam or non-spam, update the database with a weighting of
.B WEIGHT
per token instead of the default of 1.  Useful when correcting mistakes,
eg a message that has been mistakenly detected as spam should be marked as
non-spam using a weighting of 2, i.e. double the usual weighting, to
counteract the error.
.TP
.BI "\-D, \-\-dump " "[FILE]"
Dump the contents of the database as a platform-independent text file,
suitable for archival, transfer to another machine, and so on.  The data
is output on stdout or into the given
.BR FILE .
.TP
.BI "\-R, \-\-restore " "[FILE]"
Rebuild the database from scratch from the text file on stdin.  If a
.B FILE
is given, data is read from there instead of from stdin.
.TP
.B \-O, \-\-tokens
Instead of filtering, output a list of the tokens found in the message read
from standard input, along with the number of times each token was found. 
This is only useful if you want to use
.B @PACKAGE@
as a general tokeniser for use with another filtering package.
.TP
.BI "\-E, \-\-merge " "OTHERDB"
Merge the
.B OTHERDB
database into the current database.  This can be useful if you want to take
one user's mailbox and merge it into the system-wide one, for instance (this
would be done by, as root, doing
.B @PACKAGE@ -d /var/lib/@PACKAGE@db -E /home/user/.@PACKAGE@db
and then removing
.BR /home/user/.@PACKAGE@db ).
.TP
.BI "\-B, \-\-benchmark " "SPAM NONSPAM [MAXROUNDS]"
Benchmark the training process using the two mbox folders
.B SPAM
and
.BR NONSPAM .
A temporary database is created and trained using the first 75% of the
messages in each folder, and then the entire contents of each folder is
tested to see how many false positives and false negatives occur. Some
timing information is also displayed.

This can be used to decide which backend is best on your system.  Use
.B -d
to select a backend, eg
.B @PACKAGE@ -B spam nonspam -d GDBM
- this will create a temporary database which is removed afterwards.

The exception to this is the MySQL backend, where a full database
specification must be given
.BR "" "(" "-d MySQL:database=db;host=localhost;..." ")"
and the database table given will not be wiped beforehand or dropped
afterwards.

As with
.BR -T ,
if
.B MAXROUNDS
is specified, training will never be done for more than this number of
rounds; the default is 200.

.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version         
Print version information, including a list of available database backends,
on standard output and exit successfully.

.SH DEPRECATED OPTIONS

The following options are only for use with the old binary tree database
backend or old databases that haven't been upgraded to the new format that
came in with version 1.1.0.

.TP
.B \-N, \-\-no-autoprune
When marking as spam or nonspam, never automatically prune the database.
Usually the database is pruned after every 500 marks; if you would rather
.B \-\-prune
manually, use 
.B \-N
to disable automatic pruning.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-prune
Remove redundant entries from the database and clean it up a little.  This
is automatically done after several calls to
.B --mark-spam
or
.BR --mark-nonspam ,
and during training with
.B \-\-train
if the training takes a large number of rounds, so it should rarely be
necessary to use
.B \-\-prune
manually unless you are using
.BR \-N " / " \-\-no\-autoprune .
.TP
.BI "\-X, \-\-prune\-max " NUM
When the database is being pruned, no more than
.B NUM
entries will be considered for removal.  This is to prevent CPU and memory
resources being taken over.  The default is 100,000 but in some
circumstances (if you find that pruning takes too long) this option may be
used to reduce it to a more manageable number.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B /var/lib/@PACKAGE@db
The default (system-wide) spam database.  If you wish to install
.B @PACKAGE@
system-wide, this should be read-only to everyone; there should be one user
with write access who can update the spam database with
.B @PACKAGE@ --mark-spam
and
.B @PACKAGE@ --mark-non-spam
when necessary.
.TP
.B /var/lib/@PACKAGE@db2
A second, read-only, system-wide database. This can be useful when
installing
.B @PACKAGE@
system-wide and using third-party spam databases; the first global database
can be updated with system-specific changes, and this second database can be
periodically updated when the third-party spam database is updated.
.TP
.B $HOME/.@PACKAGE@db
The default spam database for per-user data.  Users without write access to
the system-wide database will have their data written here, and the two
databases will be read together.  The per-user database will be given a
weighting equivalent to 10 times the weighting of the global database.

.SH NOTES
Currently, you cannot use
.B @PACKAGE@
to check for spam while the database is being updated.  This means that
while an update is in progress, all email is passed through as non-spam.

There is an upper size limit of 512Kb on incoming email; anything larger
than this is just passed through as non-spam, to avoid tying up machine
resources.

The plaintext token mapping maintained by
.B --plain-map
will never shrink, only grow.  It is intended for use by housekeeping and
user interface scripts that, for instance, the user can use to list all
email addresses on their allow-list.  These scripts should take care of
weeding out entries for tokens that are no longer in the database.  If you
have no such scripts, there is probably no point in using
.B --plain-map
anyway.

Avoid using the deny-list
.BR "" ( -y )
in any automated retraining, as it can be cause the filter to reject
mail unnecessarily.  In general the deny-list is probably best left unused
unless explicitly required by your particular setup.

If both the allow-list and the deny-list are enabled, then email addresses
will first be checked against the deny-list, then the allow-list, then the
domain of the email address will be checked for matching "@domain" entries
in the deny-list and then in the allow-list.

.SH EXAMPLES
To filter all of your mail through
.BR @PACKAGE@ ,
with the allow-list enabled and the "spam rating" header being added, add
this to your
.B .procmailrc
file:

.RS
 :0 wf
 | @PACKAGE@ -ra
.RE

If you want
.B @PACKAGE@
to add "[SPAM]" to the subject line of any messages it thinks are spam, do
this instead:

.RS
 :0 wf
 | @PACKAGE@ -sra
.RE

To automatically mark any email sent to
.B spambox@yourdomain.com
as spam (this is the "naive" version):

.RS
 :0 H
 * ^To:.*spambox@yourdomain.com
 | @PACKAGE@ -am
.RE

To do the same, but cleverly, so that only email to
.B spambox@yourdomain.com
which
.B @PACKAGE@
does NOT already classify as spam gets marked as spam in the database (this
stops the database getting too heavily weighted):

.RS
 # If sent to spambox@yourdomain.com:
 :0
 * ^To:.*spambox@yourdomain.com
 {
    :0 wf
    | @PACKAGE@ -a

    # The above two lines can be skipped if you've
    # already piped the message through @PACKAGE@.

    # If the @PACKAGE@ database says it's not spam,
    # mark it as spam!
    :0 H
    * ^X-Spam: NO
    | @PACKAGE@ -am
 }
.RE

Remove the
.B -a
option in the above examples if you don't want to use the allow-list.

A more complicated filtering example - this will only run
.B @PACKAGE@
on messages which don't have a subject line saying "your <something> is on
fire" and which don't have a sender address ending in "@foobar.com", meaning
that messages with that subject line OR that sender address will NEVER be
marked as spam, no matter what:

.RS
 :0 wf
 * ! ^Subject: Your .* is on fire
 * ! ^From: .*@foobar.com
 | @PACKAGE@ -ra
.RE

For more on
.BR procmail (1)
recipes, see the
.BR procmailrc (5)
and
.BR procmailex (5)
manual pages.

A couple of macros to add to your
.B .muttrc
file, if you use
.BR mutt (1)
as a mail user agent:

.RS
 # Press F5 to mark a message as spam and delete it
 macro index <f5> "<pipe-message>@PACKAGE@ -am\\n<delete-message>"
 macro pager <f5> "<pipe-message>@PACKAGE@ -am\\n<delete-message>"
 
 # Press F9 to mark a message as non-spam
 macro index <f9> "<pipe-message>@PACKAGE@ -aM\\n"
 macro pager <f9> "<pipe-message>@PACKAGE@ -aM\\n"
.RE

Again, remove the
.B -a
option in the above examples if you don't want to use the allow-list.

Note, however, that the above macros won't work when operating on multiple
tagged messages. For that, you'd need something like this:

.RS
 macro index <f5> ":set pipe_split\\n<tag-prefix><pipe-message>@PACKAGE@ -am\\n<tag-prefix><delete-message>\\n:unset pipe_split\\n"
.RE

If you use
.BR qmail (7),
then to get
.B procmail
working with it you will need to put a line containing just
.B DEFAULT=./Maildir/
at the top of your
.B ~/.procmailrc
file, so that
.B procmail
delivers to your Maildir folder instead of trying to deliver to
/var/spool/mail/$USER, and you will need to put this in your
.B ~/.qmail
file:

.RS
 | preline procmail
.RE

This will cause all your mail to be delivered via
.B procmail
instead of being delivered directly into your mail directory.

See the
.BR qmail (7)
documentation for more about mail delivery with qmail.

If you use
.BR postfix (1),
you can set up a system-wide mail filter by creating a user account for the
purpose of filtering mail, populating that account's
.BR .@PACKAGE@db ,
and then creating a shell script, to run as that user, which runs
.B @PACKAGE@
on stdin and passes stdout to
.BR sendmail (8).

Doing this requires some knowledge of
.B postfix
configuration and care needs to be taken to avoid mail loops.
One
.B @PACKAGE@
user's full HOWTO is included in the
.B doc/
directory with this package.

.SH "THE ALLOW-LIST"
A feature called the "allow-list" can be switched on by specifying the
.BR \-\-allowlist " or " \-a
option.  This causes messages' "From:" and "Return-Path:" addresses to be
checked against a list of people you have said to allow all messages from,
and if a message's "From:" or "Return-Path:" address is in the list, it is
never marked as spam.  This means you can add all your friends to an
"allow-list" and
.B @PACKAGE@
will then never mis-file their messages - a quick way to do this is to use
.B -a
with
.B -T
(train); everyone in your non-spam folder who has sent you an email will be
added to the allow-list automatically during training.

You can manually add and remove addresses to and from the allow-list using
the
.B \-e
(email) option. For instance, to add
.B foo@bar.com
to the allow-list, do this:

.RS
 @PACKAGE@ -e foo@bar.com -M
.RE

To remove
.B bad@nasty.com
from the allow-list, do this:

.RS
 @PACKAGE@ -e bad@nasty.com -m
.RE

And to see whether
.B someone@somewhere.com
is in the allow-list or not, just do this:

.RS
 @PACKAGE@ -e someone@somewhere.com
.RE

In general, you probably always want to enable the allow-list, so always
specify the
.B -a
option when using
.BR @PACKAGE@ .
This will automatically maintain the allow-list based on what you classify
as spam or non-spam.

The only times you might want to turn it off are when people on your
allow-list are prone to getting viruses or if a virus is causing email to be
sent to you that is pretending to be from someone on your allow-list.

.SH "BACKUP AND RESTORE"
Because the database format is platform-specific, it is a good idea to
periodically dump the database to a text file using
.B @PACKAGE@ -D
so that, if necessary, it can be transferred to another machine and restored
with
.B @PACKAGE@ -R
later on.

Also note that since the actual contents of email messages are never stored
in the database (see
.BR "TECHNICAL DETAILS" ),
you can safely share your
.B @PACKAGE@
database with friends - simply dump your database to a file, like this:

.RS
 @PACKAGE@ -D > your-database-dump.txt
.RE

Once you have sent
.B your-database-dump.txt
to another person, they can do this:

.RS
 @PACKAGE@ -R < your-database-dump.txt
.RE

They will then have an identical database to yours.

.SH "TECHNICAL DETAILS"
When a message is passed to
.BR @PACKAGE@ ,
any attachments are decoded, all HTML elements are removed, and the message
text is then broken up into "tokens", where a "token" is a single word or
URL.  Each token is hashed using the MD5 algorithm (see below for why), and
that hash is then used to look up each token in the
.B @PACKAGE@
database.

For full details of which parts of an email (headers, body, attachments,
etc) are used to calculate the spam rating, see the
.B TOKENISATION
section below.

Within the database, each token has two numbers associated with it: the
number of times that token has been seen in spam, and the number of times it
has been seen in non-spam.  These two numbers, along with the total number
of spam and non-spam messages seen, are then used to give a "spamminess"
value for that particular token.  This "spamminess" value ranges from
"definitely not spammy" at one end of the scale, through "neutral" in the
middle, up to "definitely spammy" at the other end.

Once a "spamminess" value has been calculated for all of the tokens in the
message, a summary calculation is made to give an overall "is this spam?"
probability rating for the message.  If the overall probability is 0.9 or
above, the message is flagged as spam.

In addition to the probability test is the "allow-list".  If enabled (with
the
.B -a
option), the whole probability check is skipped if the sender of the message
is listed in the allow-list, and the message is not marked as spam.

When training the database, a message is split up into tokens as described
above, and then the numbers in the database for each token are simply added
to: if you tell
.B @PACKAGE@
that a message is spam, it adds one to the "number of times seen in spam"
counter for each token, and if you tell it a message is not spam, it adds
one to the "number of times seen in non-spam" counter for each token.  If
you specify a weight, with
.BR -w ,
then the number you specify is added instead of one.

To stop the database growing uncontrollably, the database keeps track of
when a token was last used.  Underused tokens are automatically removed from
the database.  (The old method was to "prune" every 500 updates).

Finally, the reason MD5 hashes were used is privacy.  If the actual tokens
from the messages, and the actual email addresses in the allow-list, were
stored, you could not share a single
.B @PACKAGE@
database between multiple users because bits of everyone's messages would be
in the database - things like emailed passwords, keywords relating to
personal gossip, and so on.  So a hash is stored instead.  A hash is a
"one-way" function; it is easy to turn a token into a hash but very hard
(some might say impossible) to turn a hash back into the token that created
it.  This means that you end up with a database with no personal information
in it.

.SH "TOKENISATION"

When a message is broken up into tokens, various parts of the message are
treated in different ways.

First, all header fields are discarded, except for the important ones:
.BR From ,
.BR Return-Path ,
.BR Sender ,
.BR To ,
.BR Reply-To ,
and
.BR Subject .

Next, any MIME-encoded attachments are decoded.  Any attachments whose MIME
type starts with "text/" (i.e. HTML and text) are tokenised, after having
any HTML tags stripped.  Any non-textual attachments are replaced with their
MD5 hash (such that two identical attachments will have the same hash), and
that hash is then used as a token.

In addition to single-word tokens from textual message parts,
.B @PACKAGE@
adds doubled-up tokens so that word pairs get added to the database.  This
makes the database a bit bigger (although the automatic pruning tends to
take care of that) but makes matching more exact.

.SH "SPECIAL FILTERS"
As well as using the textual content of email to detect spam,
.B @PACKAGE@
also uses special filters which create "pseudo-tokens" based on various
rules.  This means that specific patterns, not just individual words, can be
used to determine whether a message is spam or not.

For example, if a message contains lots of words with multiple consonants,
like "ashjkbnxcsdjh", then each time a word like that is seen the special
token ".GIBBERISH-CONSONANTS." is added to the list of tokens found in the
message.  If it turns out that most messages with words that trigger this
filter rule are spam, then other messages with gibberish consonant strings
will be more likely to be flagged as spam.

Currently the special filters are:

.TP
.B GTUBE
Flags any message containing the string
.B XJS*C4JDBQADN1.NSBN3*2IDNEN*GTUBE-STANDARD-ANTI-UBE-TEST-EMAIL*C.34X
as spam - useful for testing that your
.B @PACKAGE@
installation is working.
.TP
.B ATTACH-SCR
.TP
.B ATTACH-PIF
.TP
.B ATTACH-EXE
.TP
.B ATTACH-VBS
.TP
.B ATTACH-VBA
.TP
.B ATTACH-LNK
.TP
.B ATTACH-COM
.TP
.B ATTACH-BAT
Adds a token for every attachment whose filename ends in ".scr", ".pif",
".exe", ".vbs", ".vba", ".lnk", ".com", and ".bat" respectively (these are
often viruses).

.TP
.B ATTACH-GIF
.TP
.B ATTACH-JPG
.TP
.B ATTACH-PNG
Adds a token for every attachment whose filename ends in ".gif", ".jpg" or
".jpeg", and ".png" respectively.

.TP
.B ATTACH-DOC
.TP
.B ATTACH-XLS
.TP
.B ATTACH-PDF
Adds a token for every attachment whose filename ends in ".doc", ".xls", or
".pdf" respectively (these tend to indicate a non-spam email).

.TP
.B SINGLE-IMAGE
Adds a token if the message contains exactly one attached image.

.TP
.B MULTIPLE-IMAGES
Adds a token if the message contains more than one attached image.

.TP
.B GIBBERISH-CONSONANTS
Adds a token for every word found that has multiple consonants in a row, as
described above.  Spam often contains strings of gibberish.
.TP
.B GIBBERISH-VOWELS
Adds a token for every word found that has multiple vowels in a row, eg
"aeaiaiaeeio".
.TP
.B GIBBERISH-FROMCONS
Like
.BR GIBBERISH-CONSONANTS ,
but only for the "From:" and "Return-Path:" addresses on their own.
.TP
.B GIBBERISH-FROMVOWL
Like
.BR GIBBERISH-VOWELS ,
but only for the "From:" and "Return-Path:" addresses on their own.
.TP
.B GIBBERISH-BADSTART
Adds a token for every word that starts with a bad character such as %.
.TP
.B GIBBERISH-HYPHENS
Adds a token for every word with more than three hyphens or underscores in
it.
.TP
.B GIBBERISH-LONGWORDS
Adds a token for every word with over 30 characters in it (but less than 60).
.TP
.B HTML-COMMENTS-IN-WORDS
Adds a token for every HTML comment found in the middle of a word.  Spam
often contains HTML inside words, like this: w<!--dsgfhsdgjgh-->ord
.TP
.B HTML-EXTERNAL-IMG
Adds a token for every HTML <img> (image) tag found that contains :// (i.e.
it refers to an external image).
.TP
.B HTML-FONT
Adds a token for every HTML <font> tag found.
.TP
.B HTML-IP-IN-URLS
Adds a token for every URL found containing an IP address.
.TP
.B HTML-INT-IN-URL
Adds a token for every URL found containing an integer in its hostname.
.TP
.B HTML-URLENCODED-URL
Adds a token for every URL found containing a % sign in its hostname.

.P

Normally, filters will just cause a token to be added, and these tokens are
processed by the normal weighting algorithm.  However the
.B GTUBE
filter will immediately flag any matching message as spam, bypassing the
token matching.

.SH DATABASE BACKENDS

The inbuilt "list" database backend will not necessarily provide the best
performance, but is provided because using it requires no external
libraries.

If, when
.B @PACKAGE@
was compiled, the correct libraries were available, then it will be possible
to use
.B @PACKAGE@
with alternative database backends.  To find out which backends you have
available, run
.B @PACKAGE@ -V
(capital V) and read the second line of output.  To see how well a backend
performs, collect some spam and non-spam and use
.B @PACKAGE@ -d BACKEND -B SPAM NONSPAM
(see the entry for
.B -B
above).

Some people find that they get the best performance out of the
.B gdbm
backend; this is a library that is widely available on many systems.

To efficiently share a
.B @PACKAGE@
database across multiple machines, you may find the MySQL backend useful. 
However, using it is a little more complicated.

To use the MySQL backend you will need to create a table with the fields
.IR key1 ", " key2 ", " token ", " value1 ", " value2 " and " value3 .
The
.IR token ", " value1 ", " value2 ", and " value3
fields must be
.BR VARCHAR(64) ", " BIGINT " or " INT ", and " BIGINT " or " INT
respectively, and indexing on the
.I token
field is a good idea. The
.IR key1 " and " key2
fields can be anything, but they must be present.

For example:

.RS
  USE mydatabase;
  CREATE TABLE @PACKAGE@db (
    key1      BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    key2      BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    token     VARCHAR(64) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL,
    value1    INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    value2    INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    value3    INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (key1,key2,token),
    KEY (key1),
    KEY (key2),
    KEY (token)
  );
.RE

The
.IR key1 " and " key2
fields allow you to have multiple
.B @PACKAGE@
databases in one table, by specifying different
.IR key1 " and " key2
values on invocation.

Instead of specifying a database file with the
.BR --database " / " -d
option, you must specify either a specification string as described below,
or the name of a file containing such a string on its first line.

The specification string is as follows:

.RS
  database=DATABASE;host=HOST;port=PORT;
  user=USER;pass=PASS;table=TABLE;
  key1=KEY1;key2=KEY2
.RE

This string must be all on one line, with no spaces.

.TP
.B DATABASE
is the name of the MySQL database.
.TP
.B HOST
is the hostname of the database server (eg "localhost").
.TP
.B PORT
is the TCP port to connect on (eg 3306).
.TP
.B USER
is the username to connect with.
.TP
.B PASS
is the password to connect with.
.TP
.B TABLE
is the database table to use.  If a table with this name does not exist when
.B @PACKAGE@
is called in update or training mode, then it will be created if permissions
allow this to be done.
.TP
.B KEY1
is the value to use for the
.I key1
field.
.TP
.B KEY2
is the value to use for the
.I key2
field.

.P

Since command lines can be seen in the process list, it is probably best to
specify a filename (eg
.BR "@PACKAGE@ -d mysql:@PACKAGE@db.spec" )
and put the specification string inside that file.

.SH TROUBLESHOOTING

If you have problems with
.BR @PACKAGE@ ,
please check the list below; if this does not help, go to the
.B @PACKAGE@
home page and investigate the mailing lists, or email the author.

.TP
.B Nothing is being marked as spam.
.br
First, use the
.B -r
option to switch on the
.B X-Spam-Rating
header, and check that this header appears in email passed through
.BR @PACKAGE@ .
If it does not, then it is likely that
.B @PACKAGE@
is not being run at all - check your configuration of
.BR procmail (1)
or its equivalent.
.TP
.B " "
.br
If you are seeing
.B X-Spam-Rating
headers, and different emails have different scores, then you may simply
need to retrain your database a little more.  Take more spam email and pass
it to
.BR "@PACKAGE@ -m" .
.TP
.B " "
.br
If you are seeing
.B X-Spam-Rating
headers but they all give the same spam rating, then the most likely reason
is that
.B @PACKAGE@
is not reading any database.  Make sure that whatever is processing the email
has read permissions on
.B /var/lib/@PACKAGE@db
and/or
.B ~/.@PACKAGE@db
- and make sure that, if you are using
.BR ~/.@PACKAGE@db ,
what your database creator thought was
.BR ~ " (" $HOME ")"
is the same as it is for whatever is processing the email.

.TP
.B Retraining sometimes takes a very long time.
With the 
.B obtree
backend or 2-column MySQL or SQLite tables, every 500th retrain
.BR "" "(" -m " or " -M "),"
the database is pruned.  On some systems this may take some time, and during
this time the database is locked (except when using the MySQL or SQLite backends).
If you constantly do a lot of retraining and want to avoid this, then use
the
.B -N
option to suppress auto-pruning, and then have a
.BR cron (8)
job or something run a manual prune
.BR "" "(" "@PACKAGE@ -p" ")"
every now and again.

.TP
.B Running @PACKAGE@ from procmail fails with an error.
If you can run
.B @PACKAGE@
from the command line, but in your
.B procmail
log file you get errors about "@PACKAGE@: cannot execute binary file", then
contact your system administrator for help. It may be that incoming email is
handled by a different server to the one you normally shell into, and either
they are of a different architecture or operating system, or the mail server
is not permitted to execute user-owned binaries.
