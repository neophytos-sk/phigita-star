<div class="SECT1">
  <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="WAL-ASYNC-COMMIT" id=
  "WAL-ASYNC-COMMIT">29.3. Asynchronous Commit</a></h1>

  <p><i class="FIRSTTERM">Asynchronous commit</i> is an option that
  allows transactions to complete more quickly, at the cost that
  the most recent transactions may be lost if the database should
  crash. In many applications this is an acceptable trade-off.</p>

  <p>As described in the previous section, transaction commit is
  normally <i class="FIRSTTERM">synchronous</i>: the server waits
  for the transaction's <acronym class="ACRONYM">WAL</acronym>
  records to be flushed to permanent storage before returning a
  success indication to the client. The client is therefore
  guaranteed that a transaction reported to be committed will be
  preserved, even in the event of a server crash immediately after.
  However, for short transactions this delay is a major component
  of the total transaction time. Selecting asynchronous commit mode
  means that the server returns success as soon as the transaction
  is logically completed, before the <acronym class=
  "ACRONYM">WAL</acronym> records it generated have actually made
  their way to disk. This can provide a significant boost in
  throughput for small transactions.</p>

  <p>Asynchronous commit introduces the risk of data loss. There is
  a short time window between the report of transaction completion
  to the client and the time that the transaction is truly
  committed (that is, it is guaranteed not to be lost if the server
  crashes). Thus asynchronous commit should not be used if the
  client will take external actions relying on the assumption that
  the transaction will be remembered. As an example, a bank would
  certainly not use asynchronous commit for a transaction recording
  an ATM's dispensing of cash. But in many scenarios, such as event
  logging, there is no need for a strong guarantee of this
  kind.</p>

  <p>The risk that is taken by using asynchronous commit is of data
  loss, not data corruption. If the database should crash, it will
  recover by replaying <acronym class="ACRONYM">WAL</acronym> up to
  the last record that was flushed. The database will therefore be
  restored to a self-consistent state, but any transactions that
  were not yet flushed to disk will not be reflected in that state.
  The net effect is therefore loss of the last few transactions.
  Because the transactions are replayed in commit order, no
  inconsistency can be introduced â€” for example, if transaction B
  made changes relying on the effects of a previous transaction A,
  it is not possible for A's effects to be lost while B's effects
  are preserved.</p>

  <p>The user can select the commit mode of each transaction, so
  that it is possible to have both synchronous and asynchronous
  commit transactions running concurrently. This allows flexible
  trade-offs between performance and certainty of transaction
  durability. The commit mode is controlled by the user-settable
  parameter <a href=
  "runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-SYNCHRONOUS-COMMIT">synchronous_commit</a>,
  which can be changed in any of the ways that a configuration
  parameter can be set. The mode used for any one transaction
  depends on the value of <tt class=
  "VARNAME">synchronous_commit</tt> when transaction commit
  begins.</p>

  <p>Certain utility commands, for instance <tt class=
  "COMMAND">DROP TABLE</tt>, are forced to commit synchronously
  regardless of the setting of <tt class=
  "VARNAME">synchronous_commit</tt>. This is to ensure consistency
  between the server's file system and the logical state of the
  database. The commands supporting two-phase commit, such as
  <tt class="COMMAND">PREPARE TRANSACTION</tt>, are also always
  synchronous.</p>

  <p>If the database crashes during the risk window between an
  asynchronous commit and the writing of the transaction's
  <acronym class="ACRONYM">WAL</acronym> records, then changes made
  during that transaction <span class=
  "emphasis EMPHASIS c2">will</span> be lost. The duration of the
  risk window is limited because a background process (the
  <span class="QUOTE">"WAL writer"</span>) flushes unwritten
  <acronym class="ACRONYM">WAL</acronym> records to disk every
  <a href=
  "runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-WAL-WRITER-DELAY">wal_writer_delay</a>
  milliseconds. The actual maximum duration of the risk window is
  three times <tt class="VARNAME">wal_writer_delay</tt> because the
  WAL writer is designed to favor writing whole pages at a time
  during busy periods.</p>

  <div class="CAUTION">
    <table class="CAUTION" border="1" width="100%">
      <tr>
        <td class="c3" align="center">Caution</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td align="left">
          <p>An immediate-mode shutdown is equivalent to a server
          crash, and will therefore cause loss of any unflushed
          asynchronous commits.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>Asynchronous commit provides behavior different from setting
  <a href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-FSYNC">fsync</a> = off.
  <tt class="VARNAME">fsync</tt> is a server-wide setting that will
  alter the behavior of all transactions. It disables all logic
  within <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> that attempts
  to synchronize writes to different portions of the database, and
  therefore a system crash (that is, a hardware or operating system
  crash, not a failure of <span class=
  "PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> itself) could result in
  arbitrarily bad corruption of the database state. In many
  scenarios, asynchronous commit provides most of the performance
  improvement that could be obtained by turning off <tt class=
  "VARNAME">fsync</tt>, but without the risk of data
  corruption.</p>

  <p><a href=
  "runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-COMMIT-DELAY">commit_delay</a> also
  sounds very similar to asynchronous commit, but it is actually a
  synchronous commit method (in fact, <tt class=
  "VARNAME">commit_delay</tt> is ignored during an asynchronous
  commit). <tt class="VARNAME">commit_delay</tt> causes a delay
  just before a synchronous commit attempts to flush
  <acronym class="ACRONYM">WAL</acronym> to disk, in the hope that
  a single flush executed by one such transaction can also serve
  other transactions committing at about the same time. Setting
  <tt class="VARNAME">commit_delay</tt> can only help when there
  are many concurrently committing transactions, and it is
  difficult to tune it to a value that actually helps rather than
  hurts throughput.</p>
