<div class="SECT1">
  <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="WAL-CONFIGURATION" id=
  "WAL-CONFIGURATION">29.4. <acronym class="ACRONYM">WAL</acronym>
  Configuration</a></h1>

  <p>There are several <acronym class=
  "ACRONYM">WAL</acronym>-related configuration parameters that
  affect database performance. This section explains their use.
  Consult <a href="runtime-config.html">Chapter 18</a> for general
  information about setting server configuration parameters.</p>

  <p><i class="FIRSTTERM">Checkpoints</i> are points in the
  sequence of transactions at which it is guaranteed that the heap
  and index data files have been updated with all information
  written before the checkpoint. At checkpoint time, all dirty data
  pages are flushed to disk and a special checkpoint record is
  written to the log file. (The changes were previously flushed to
  the <acronym class="ACRONYM">WAL</acronym> files.) In the event
  of a crash, the crash recovery procedure looks at the latest
  checkpoint record to determine the point in the log (known as the
  redo record) from which it should start the REDO operation. Any
  changes made to data files before that point are guaranteed to be
  already on disk. Hence, after a checkpoint, log segments
  preceding the one containing the redo record are no longer needed
  and can be recycled or removed. (When <acronym class=
  "ACRONYM">WAL</acronym> archiving is being done, the log segments
  must be archived before being recycled or removed.)</p>

  <p>The checkpoint requirement of flushing all dirty data pages to
  disk can cause a significant I/O load. For this reason,
  checkpoint activity is throttled so I/O begins at checkpoint
  start and completes before the next checkpoint starts; this
  minimizes performance degradation during checkpoints.</p>

  <p>The server's background writer process automatically performs
  a checkpoint every so often. A checkpoint is created every
  <a href=
  "runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-CHECKPOINT-SEGMENTS">checkpoint_segments</a>
  log segments, or every <a href=
  "runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-CHECKPOINT-TIMEOUT">checkpoint_timeout</a>
  seconds, whichever comes first. The default settings are 3
  segments and 300 seconds (5 minutes), respectively. It is also
  possible to force a checkpoint by using the SQL command
  <tt class="COMMAND">CHECKPOINT</tt>.</p>

  <p>Reducing <tt class="VARNAME">checkpoint_segments</tt> and/or
  <tt class="VARNAME">checkpoint_timeout</tt> causes checkpoints to
  occur more often. This allows faster after-crash recovery (since
  less work will need to be redone). However, one must balance this
  against the increased cost of flushing dirty data pages more
  often. If <a href=
  "runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-FULL-PAGE-WRITES">full_page_writes</a>
  is set (as is the default), there is another factor to consider.
  To ensure data page consistency, the first modification of a data
  page after each checkpoint results in logging the entire page
  content. In that case, a smaller checkpoint interval increases
  the volume of output to the WAL log, partially negating the goal
  of using a smaller interval, and in any case causing more disk
  I/O.</p>

  <p>Checkpoints are fairly expensive, first because they require
  writing out all currently dirty buffers, and second because they
  result in extra subsequent WAL traffic as discussed above. It is
  therefore wise to set the checkpointing parameters high enough
  that checkpoints don't happen too often. As a simple sanity check
  on your checkpointing parameters, you can set the <a href=
  "runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-CHECKPOINT-WARNING">checkpoint_warning</a>
  parameter. If checkpoints happen closer together than <tt class=
  "VARNAME">checkpoint_warning</tt> seconds, a message will be
  output to the server log recommending increasing <tt class=
  "VARNAME">checkpoint_segments</tt>. Occasional appearance of such
  a message is not cause for alarm, but if it appears often then
  the checkpoint control parameters should be increased. Bulk
  operations such as large <tt class="COMMAND">COPY</tt> transfers
  might cause a number of such warnings to appear if you have not
  set <tt class="VARNAME">checkpoint_segments</tt> high enough.</p>

  <p>To avoid flooding the I/O system with a burst of page writes,
  writing dirty buffers during a checkpoint is spread over a period
  of time. That period is controlled by <a href=
  "runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-CHECKPOINT-COMPLETION-TARGET">checkpoint_completion_target</a>,
  which is given as a fraction of the checkpoint interval. The I/O
  rate is adjusted so that the checkpoint finishes when the given
  fraction of <tt class="VARNAME">checkpoint_segments</tt> WAL
  segments have been consumed since checkpoint start, or the given
  fraction of <tt class="VARNAME">checkpoint_timeout</tt> seconds
  have elapsed, whichever is sooner. With the default value of 0.5,
  <span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> can be expected to
  complete each checkpoint in about half the time before the next
  checkpoint starts. On a system that's very close to maximum I/O
  throughput during normal operation, you might want to increase
  <tt class="VARNAME">checkpoint_completion_target</tt> to reduce
  the I/O load from checkpoints. The disadvantage of this is that
  prolonging checkpoints affects recovery time, because more WAL
  segments will need to be kept around for possible use in
  recovery. Although <tt class=
  "VARNAME">checkpoint_completion_target</tt> can be set as high as
  1.0, it is best to keep it less than that (perhaps 0.9 at most)
  since checkpoints include some other activities besides writing
  dirty buffers. A setting of 1.0 is quite likely to result in
  checkpoints not being completed on time, which would result in
  performance loss due to unexpected variation in the number of WAL
  segments needed.</p>

  <p>There will always be at least one WAL segment file, and will
  normally not be more than (2 + <tt class=
  "VARNAME">checkpoint_completion_target</tt>) * <tt class=
  "VARNAME">checkpoint_segments</tt> + 1 or <tt class=
  "VARNAME">checkpoint_segments</tt> + <a href=
  "runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-WAL-KEEP-SEGMENTS">wal_keep_segments</a>
  + 1 files. Each segment file is normally 16 MB (though this size
  can be altered when building the server). You can use this to
  estimate space requirements for <acronym class=
  "ACRONYM">WAL</acronym>. Ordinarily, when old log segment files
  are no longer needed, they are recycled (renamed to become the
  next segments in the numbered sequence). If, due to a short-term
  peak of log output rate, there are more than 3 * <tt class=
  "VARNAME">checkpoint_segments</tt> + 1 segment files, the
  unneeded segment files will be deleted instead of recycled until
  the system gets back under this limit.</p>

  <p>In archive recovery or standby mode, the server periodically
  performs <i class="FIRSTTERM">restartpoints</i> which are similar
  to checkpoints in normal operation: the server forces all its
  state to disk, updates the <tt class="FILENAME">pg_control</tt>
  file to indicate that the already-processed WAL data need not be
  scanned again, and then recycles any old log segment files in
  <tt class="FILENAME">pg_xlog</tt> directory. A restartpoint is
  triggered if at least one checkpoint record has been replayed and
  <tt class="VARNAME">checkpoint_timeout</tt> seconds have passed
  since last restartpoint. In standby mode, a restartpoint is also
  triggered if <tt class="VARNAME">checkpoint_segments</tt> log
  segments have been replayed since last restartpoint and at least
  one checkpoint record has been replayed. Restartpoints can't be
  performed more frequently than checkpoints in the master because
  restartpoints can only be performed at checkpoint records.</p>

  <p>There are two commonly used internal <acronym class=
  "ACRONYM">WAL</acronym> functions: <code class=
  "FUNCTION">LogInsert</code> and <code class=
  "FUNCTION">LogFlush</code>. <code class=
  "FUNCTION">LogInsert</code> is used to place a new record into
  the <acronym class="ACRONYM">WAL</acronym> buffers in shared
  memory. If there is no space for the new record, <code class=
  "FUNCTION">LogInsert</code> will have to write (move to kernel
  cache) a few filled <acronym class="ACRONYM">WAL</acronym>
  buffers. This is undesirable because <code class=
  "FUNCTION">LogInsert</code> is used on every database low level
  modification (for example, row insertion) at a time when an
  exclusive lock is held on affected data pages, so the operation
  needs to be as fast as possible. What is worse, writing
  <acronym class="ACRONYM">WAL</acronym> buffers might also force
  the creation of a new log segment, which takes even more time.
  Normally, <acronym class="ACRONYM">WAL</acronym> buffers should
  be written and flushed by a <code class=
  "FUNCTION">LogFlush</code> request, which is made, for the most
  part, at transaction commit time to ensure that transaction
  records are flushed to permanent storage. On systems with high
  log output, <code class="FUNCTION">LogFlush</code> requests might
  not occur often enough to prevent <code class=
  "FUNCTION">LogInsert</code> from having to do writes. On such
  systems one should increase the number of <acronym class=
  "ACRONYM">WAL</acronym> buffers by modifying the configuration
  parameter <a href=
  "runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-WAL-BUFFERS">wal_buffers</a>. When
  <a href=
  "runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-FULL-PAGE-WRITES">full_page_writes</a>
  is set and the system is very busy, setting this value higher
  will help smooth response times during the period immediately
  following each checkpoint.</p>

  <p>The <a href=
  "runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-COMMIT-DELAY">commit_delay</a>
  parameter defines for how many microseconds the server process
  will sleep after writing a commit record to the log with
  <code class="FUNCTION">LogInsert</code> but before performing a
  <code class="FUNCTION">LogFlush</code>. This delay allows other
  server processes to add their commit records to the log so as to
  have all of them flushed with a single log sync. No sleep will
  occur if <a href="runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-FSYNC">fsync</a> is
  not enabled, or if fewer than <a href=
  "runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-COMMIT-SIBLINGS">commit_siblings</a>
  other sessions are currently in active transactions; this avoids
  sleeping when it's unlikely that any other session will commit
  soon. Note that on most platforms, the resolution of a sleep
  request is ten milliseconds, so that any nonzero <tt class=
  "VARNAME">commit_delay</tt> setting between 1 and 10000
  microseconds would have the same effect. Good values for these
  parameters are not yet clear; experimentation is encouraged.</p>

  <p>The <a href=
  "runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-WAL-SYNC-METHOD">wal_sync_method</a>
  parameter determines how <span class=
  "PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> will ask the kernel to force
  <acronym class="ACRONYM">WAL</acronym> updates out to disk. All
  the options should be the same in terms of reliability, with the
  exception of <tt class="LITERAL">fsync_writethrough</tt>, which
  can sometimes force a flush of the disk cache even when other
  options do not do so. However, it's quite platform-specific which
  one will be the fastest; you can test option speeds using the
  <a href="pgtestfsync.html">pg_test_fsync</a> module. Note that
  this parameter is irrelevant if <tt class="VARNAME">fsync</tt>
  has been turned off.</p>

  <p>Enabling the <a href=
  "runtime-config-developer.html#GUC-WAL-DEBUG">wal_debug</a>
  configuration parameter (provided that <span class=
  "PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> has been compiled with support
  for it) will result in each <code class=
  "FUNCTION">LogInsert</code> and <code class=
  "FUNCTION">LogFlush</code> <acronym class="ACRONYM">WAL</acronym>
  call being logged to the server log. This option might be
  replaced by a more general mechanism in the future.</p>
