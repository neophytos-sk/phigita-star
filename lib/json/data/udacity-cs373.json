You will learn the basics of all the primary systems involved in programming a robotic car.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q2\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nWhy should I learn how to build a robot car?\n</b><br/>\nFirst of all, this is a fascinating subject. The technologies involved are cutting edge, but the theories behind them are simpler than you might think. In addition to learning the math and science behind these technologies, you will also improve your coding probabilities as you solve the same problems that scientists at places like Google, Stanford, and MIT have been working on for years. Having these skills will not only be personally fulfilling, but could have benefits to your professional life as well. Taking this course is the first step that you can take towards creating a world where every car on the road drives itself. If you love learning or just hate traffic, this course is for you.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q3\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nWhat programming language does the course use?\n</b><br/>\nWe will be using Python (Version 2.6). The concepts we cover in the class are not specific to Python, but apply to computer science in general no matter what programming language you are using.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q4\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nWhat type of math will I be learning in this course?\n</b><br/>\nThis course will teach basic <a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/video/basic-probability?topic=probability\">probability</a> and <a href=\"http://www.khanacademy.org/video/introduction-to-matrices?topic=algebra-matrices\">linear algebra</a>. Feel free to browse these links and the lessons that follow them on Khan Academy if you need some review. \n</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q5\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nIs there a course textbook?\n</b><br/>\nThere is no required textbook for the course, and the course content does not follow any textbook. There are many books available on probability, linear algebra, and Python programming that may be helpful to students.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q6\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nAre there homework assignments?\n</b><br/>\nYes, there are six homework assignments, one at the end of each unit. To learn anything, but especially a subject as diverse as programming a robotic car, it is necessary to solve progressively more challenging problems on your own, and the homeworks will give you an opportunity to use what you have learned and develop your programming skills. The homework assignments will be similar to the in-class quizzes and mostly cover material from that week's unit, except the homework assignments will include larger problems for you to solve on your own.  \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q7\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nIs there a final exam?\n</b><br/>\nYes. There will be an opportunity to do a final exam, roughly every 8 weeks. The dates will be announced.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q8\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nHow will my final grade be determined?\n</b><br/>\nYour final grade will be the determined by your score in exam. You can study at your own pace and take the next offered exam, when you are ready!\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q9\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nDo I need to download Python on my computer?\n</b><br/>\nYou do not need to download Python to take the course, as we provide all the necessary tools right in your browser. If you prefer to experiment locally you can download <a href=\"http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.6.8/\">Python</a>.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q10\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nHow do I get help?\n</b><br/>\nWe love to see an active academic community, so we encourage you to post your question to the <a href=\"http://forums.udacity.com/cs373-april2012\">forum</a>. Hopefully one of your peers will provide an adequate answer, but if not one of our course managers will chime in.\n\n</p>\n<p>\n\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q11\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nI think one of the quizzes or homework assignments is judging my answer incorrectly, who do I contact?\n</b><br/>\nPost your solution to the <a href=\"http://forums.udacity.com/cs373-april2012\">forum</a> with a tag \"spoiler\" and we will look into it.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q12\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nWhat are office hours?\n</b><br/>\nIn the first run of the class once a week we took some of the top questions from the forum and Sebastian and Andy answered them in a recorded video. \n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q13\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nSomething on the site isn't working, who do I contact?\n</b><br/>\nFill out the Contact Us form found at the bottom of each Udacity webpage.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div><a name=\"q14\"></a>\n<p>\n<b class=\"sans\">\nWhat are the rules on collaboration?\n</b><br/>\nWorking with other students is often the best way to learn new things, and we hope students in the class will form vibrant communities, both on-line and in-person, to help each other learn.  The key is to use collaboration as a way to enhance learning, not as a way of sharing answers without understanding them.  \n</p>\n<p>\nYou are welcome (and encouraged) to view the lectures with others, and discuss and work together on answering the in-lecture quizzes.  For the homeworks, you may discuss the questions with other students in the on-line forums and in-person study groups, but everything you submit should be your own work.  For the final exam, you are not permitted to work with anyone else, and should only ask clarification questions on the on-line forums which will be answered by the course staff.\n</p>\n</div>", "syllabus": "<p><b>Description</b>: \n\t\tThis class, taught by one of the foremost experts in AI, will teach you basic methods in Artificial Intelligence, including: probabilistic inference, planning and search, localization, tracking and control, all with a focus on robotics.

00:00:06,000\nLet's look at the measurement of this robot in its world with 5 different grid cells--\n\n2\n00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000\nx1 through x5.\n\n3\n00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000\nLet's assume 2 of those cells are colored red whereas the other 33 are green.\n\n4\n00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000\nAs before, we assign uniform probability to each cell of 0.2,\n\n5\n00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000\nand our robot is now allowed to sense.\n\n6\n00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000\nWhat it sees is a red color.\n\n7\n00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000\nHow will this affect my belief over different places?\n\n8\n00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000\nObviously, the one's for x2 and x3 should go up,\n\n9\n00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000\nand the ones for x1, x4, and x5 should go down.\n\n10\n00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000\nSo I'm going to tell you how to incorporate this measurement into our belief\n\n11\n00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000\nwith a very simple rule--a product.\n\n12\n00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000\nAny cell where the color is correct--any of the red cells--\n\n13\n00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000\nwe multiply it with a relatively large number--say, 0.6.\n\n14\n00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000\nThat feels small, but as we will see later, it is actually a large number.\n\n15\n00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000\nWhereas all the green cells will be multiple with 0.2.\n\n16\n00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000\nIf we look at the ratio of those, then it seems about 3 times as likely\n\n17\n00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000\nto be in a red cell than it is to be in a green cell,\n\n18\n00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000\nbecause 0.6 is 3 times larger than 0.2.\n\n19\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000\nNow let's do the multiplication.\n\n20\n00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000\nFor each of those 5 cells, can you tell me what the result would be \n\n21\n00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000\nmultiplying in the measurement in the way I've stated.\n\n22\n00:01:34,000 -->

over here,\n\n3\n00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000\nand 0.1 of this, which is 0.05 ends up over here.\n\n4\n00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000\nThe reason why I write it so small is because this is not the correct answer quite yet.\n\n5\n00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000\nLet's look at the other 0.5.\n\n6\n00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000\n0.4 goes two steps--1, 2--and ends up over here on the left side,\n\n7\n00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000\nbut 0.1 falls short and makes the 0.5 over here 0.05 in the second grid cell.\n\n8\n00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000\nAnd interestingly enough, for the cell on the right side,\n\n9\n00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000\nthere's two possibly ways you could've gotten there.\n\n10\n00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000\nEither by overshooting starting in the second

to motivate what we're trying to achieve in this class,\n\n5\n00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000\nlet me show you some videos.\n\n6\n00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000\nMy interest in self-driving cars started with the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2004\n\n7\n00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000\nin which my team at Stanford developed Stanley, \n\n8\n00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000\na robot that could drive itself through the Mojave Desert.\n\n9\n00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000\nThe vehicle was based on a Volkswagen Touareg \n\n10\n00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000\nthat was equipped with all kinds of sensors like GPS and laser,\n\n11\n00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000\nand it was able to make its own decisions without any human input whatsoever.\n\n12\n00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000\nThe DARPA Grand Challenge was a government-sponsored race\n\n13\n00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000\n that took place in 2005.\n\n14\n00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000\nHere we see our robot Stanley moving through the desert \n\n15\n00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000\ncompletely without a human on board.\n\n16\n00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000\nThe task was to drive a desert trail for about 130 miles, \n\n17\n00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000\nand whoever was fastest would win the race.\n\n18\n00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000\nHere we're passing a different robot by Carnegie Mellon University\n\n19\n00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000\nabout 110 miles into the race.\n\n20\n00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000\nOur robot was able to navigate really steep mountainous roads\n\n21\n00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000\nand able to avoid collisions with rocks or falling down a cliff\n\n22\n00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000\nall based on its ability to use what I'm going to teach you in this class.\n\n23\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000\nAfter almost 7 hours and 131 miles I robot returned all the way to the starting base\n\n24\n00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000\nas the first robot to ever finish a DARPA Grand Challenge\n\n25\n00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000\nwinning Stanford University 2 million bucks\n\n26\n00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000\nand Stanley a place in the Smithsonian Museum of American History.\n\n27\n00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000\nThis work led to the Urban Challenge, in which we built another robot called Junior\n\n28\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000\nthat eventually took second place.\n\n29\n00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000\nThe Urban Challenge was a followup race by DARPA\n\n30\n00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000\nin which cars were asked to drive in traffic,\n\n31\n00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000\nwhere as the Grand Challenge was king of a motionless desert floor,\n\n32\n00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000\nthis was a mock urban city where the robot was able to interact with other traffic\n\n33\n00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000\nand had to follow the traffic rules as in this left turn over here.\n\n34\n00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000\nIt had to be stay on lanes with very high precision,\n\n35\n00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000\naccommodate oncoming traffic and just drive confidently\n\n36\n00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000\nin a situation that really resembled a small city.\n\n37\n00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000\nThis led at Google to a sequence of experiments\n\n38\n00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000\n known as the Google self-driving car.\n\n39\n00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000\nI believe these are the best robotic cars out there today.\n\n40\n00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000\nHere we see one of our Priuses on University Avenue in Palo Alto\n\n41\n00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000\nkind of undetected driving just like a human driving just like a human driver,\n\n42\n00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000\nbut this car was driving by itself.\n\n43\n00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000\nOur cars have been able to drive hundreds of thousands of miles\n\n44\n00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000\n all across California and some of Nevada,\n\n45\n00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000\n in downtown areas like San Francisco, on busy highways.\n\n46\n00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000\nHere in Monterrey, a small coastal city in California with lots and lots of pedestrians.\n\n47\n00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000\nThese are all completely self-driving moments where the car is able to accommodate\n\n48\n00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000\n things like deer in the headlights in the middle of the night\n\n49\n00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000\nor even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco as shown in this video.\n\n50\n00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000\nThis is what I'm doing on my day

00:00:05,000\nSo let's dive in and study artificial intelligence for robotics.\n\n2\n00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000\nThe very first problem I'm trying to solve is called localization.\n\n3\n00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000\nIt involves a robot that's lost in space.\n\n4\n00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000\nIt could be a car. It could be a mobile robot.\n\n5\n00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000\nSo here is the environment, and the poor robot has no clue where it is.\n\n6\n00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000\nSimilarly, we might have a car driving on a highway, \n\n7\n00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000\nand this car would like to know where it is.\n\n8\n00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000\nIt is inside the lane or is it crossing lane markers?\n\n9\n00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000\nNow the traditional way to solve this problem is by using satellites.\n\n10\n00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000\nThese satellites emit signals that the car can perceive.\n\n11\n00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000\nThat's known as GPS, short for \"global positioning system,\"\n\n12\n00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000\nand it's what you have in your dashboard if you have a car with GPS\n\n13\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000\nthat shows you the maps and shows you where you are.\n\n14\n00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000\nNow unfortunately, the problem with GPS is its really not very accurate.\n\n15\n00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000\nIt's really common for a car to believe to be here but it has\n\n16\n00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000\n2 meters all the way up to 10 meters of error.\n\n17\n00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000\nSo if you try to stay in the lane with 10 meters of error,\n\n18\n00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000\nyou're far off, and you're driving right over here, and you crash.\n\n19\n00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000\nSo for our self-driving cars, to be able to stay in lanes using localization,\n\n20\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000\nwe need something like 2-10 centimeters of error.\n\n21\n00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000\nThen we can drive with GPS in lanes.\n\n22\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000\nThe question is, how can we know where were are with 10 cm accuracy?\n\n23\n00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000\nThat's the localization question.\n\n24\n00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000\nIn the Google self-driving car, localization plays a key role.\n\n25\n00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000\nWe record images of the road surface and then use the techniques \n\n26\n00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000\nI'm just about to teach you to find out exactly where the robot is.\n\n27\n00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000\nIt does so within a few centimeters of accuracy,\n\n28\n00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000\nand that makes it possible to stay inside the lane even if the lane markers are missing.\n\n29\n00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000\nSo localization has a lot of math, but before I dive into mathematical detail,\n\n30\n00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000\nI want to give you an intuition for the basic principles.\n\n31\n00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000\nI want to tell you the story of how we will localize this,\n\n32\n00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000\nand then we can go through the math together so you can understand it.\n\n33\n00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000\nI also want to let you program your own localizer \n\n34\n00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000\nso you can program a self-driving car.\n\n", "id": 3001}, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cj4LEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GAIMCxIGTnVnZ2V0GOsHDA", "path":

00:00:05,000\nWow, you've basically programmed the Google self-driving car localization\n\n2\n00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000\neven though you might not quite known it yet.\n\n3\n00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000\nLet me tell you where we are.\n\n4\n00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000\nWe talked about measurement updates, and we talked about motion.\n\n5\n00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000\nWe called these two routines \"sense\" and \"move.\"\n\n6\n00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000\nNow, localization is nothing else but the iteration of \"sense\" and \"move.\"\n\n7\n00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000\nThere is an initial belief that is tossed into this loop if you.\n\n8\n00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000\nIf you sense first, if comes to the left side.\n\n9\n00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000\nThen localization cycles through these--move, sense, move, sense, move, sense.\n\n10\n00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000\nmove, sense, move, sense cycle.\n\n11\n00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000\nEvery time the robot moves, it loses information as to where it is.\n\n12\n00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000\nThat's because robot motion is inaccurate.\n\n13\n00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000\nEvery time it senses it gains information.\n\n14\n00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000\nThat is manifest by the fact that after motion, \n\n15\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000\nthe probability distribution is a little bit flatter and a bit more spread out.\n\n16\n00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000\nand after sensing, it's focused a little bit more.\n\n17\n00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000\nIn fact, as a foot note, there is a measure of information called \"entropy.\"\n\n18\n00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000\nHere is one of the many ways you can write it:\n\n19\n00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000\n[-\u01a9p(xi)log p(xi)]\n\n20\n00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000\nas the expected local likelihood of the probability of each grid cell.\n\n21\n00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000\nWithout going into detail, this is a measure of information that the distribution has,\n\n22\n00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000\nand it can be shown that the update step, the motion step, makes the entropy go down,\n\n23\n00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000\nand the measurement step makes it go up.\n\n24\n00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000\nYou really losing and gaining information.\n\n25\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000\nI would no love to implement this in our code.\n\n26\n00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000\nIn addition to the 2 measurements we had before, red and green,\n\n27\n00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000\nI'm going to give you 2 motions--1 and 1, \n\n28\n00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000\nwhich means the robot moves right and right again.\n\n29\n00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000\nCan you compute the posterior distribution if the robot first senses red,\n\n30\n00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000\nthen moves right by 1, then senses green, then moves right again?\n\n31\n00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000\nLet's start with a uniform prior distribution.\n\n",

\n\n2\n00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000\nLet's assume the robot has no clue where it is.\n\n3\n00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000\nThen we remodel this with a function--I'm going to draw into this diagram over here\n\n4\n00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000\nwhere the vertical axis is the probability for any location in this world,\n\n5\n00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000\nand the horizontal axis corresponds to all the places in this 1-dimensional world.\n\n6\n00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000\nThe way I'm going to model the robot's current belief about where it might be,\n\n7\n00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000\nit's confusion is by a uniform function that assigns equal weight\n\n8\n00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000\n to every possible place in this world.\n\n9\n00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000\nThat is the state of maximum confusion\n\n10\n00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000\nNow, to localize the world has to have some distinctive features.\n\n11\n00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000\nLet's assume there are 3 different landmarks in the world.\n\n12\n00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000\nThere is a door over here, there's a door over here, and a 3rd one way back here.\n\n13\n00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000\nFor the sake of the argument, \n\n14\n00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000\nlet's assume they all look alike, so they're not distinguishable,\n\n15\n00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000\nbut you can distinguish the door from the non-door area--from the wall.\n\n16\n00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000\nNow let's see how the robot can localize itself by assuming it senses,\n\n17\n00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000\nand it senses that it's standing right next to a door.\n\n18\n00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000\nSo all it knows now is that it is located, likely, next to a door.\n\n19\n00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000\nHowever would this affect our belief?\n\n20\n00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000\nHere is the critical step for localization.\n\n21\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000\nIf you understand this step, you understand localization.\n\n22\n00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000\nThe measurement of a door transforms our belief function,\n\n23\n00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000\ndefined over possible locations, to a new function that looks pretty much like this.\n\n24\n00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000\nFor the 3 locations adjacent to doors, we now have an increased belief of being there\n\n25\n00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000\nwhereas all the other locations have a decreased belief.\n\n26\n00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000\nThis is a probability distribution that assigns higher probability for being next to a door,\n\n27\n00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:00,000\nand it's called the posterior belief where the word \"posterior\" means it's after a measurement has been taken.\n\n28\n00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000\nNow, the key aspect of this belief is that we still don't know where we are.\n\n29\n00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000\nThere are 3 possible door locations, and in fact, it might be\n\n30\n00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000\nthat the sensors were erroneous, and we accidentally saw a door where there's none.\n\n31\n00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000\nSo there is still a residual probability of being in these places over here, \n\n32\n00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000\nbut these three bumps together really express our current best belief of where we are.\n\n33\n00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000\nThis representation is absolutely core to probability and to more world localization. \n\n34\n00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000\nNow let's assume the robot moves.\n\n35\n00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000\nSay it moves to the right by a certain distance.\n\n36\n00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000\nThen we can shift the belief according to the motion.\n\n37\n00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000\nAnd the way this might look like is about like this.\n\n38\n00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000\nSo this bump over here made it to here.\n\n39\n00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000\nThis guy went over here, and this guy over here.\n\n40\n00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000\nObviously, this robot knows its heading direction.\n\n41\n00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000\nIt's moving to the right in this example,\n\n42\n00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000\nand it knows roughly how far it moved.\n\n43\n00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000\nNow, robot motion is somewhat uncertain.\n\n44\n00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000\nWe can never be certain where the robot moved.\n\n45\n00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000\nSo these things are a little bit flatter than these guys over here.\n\n46\n00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000\nThe process of moving those bleeps to the right side is technically called a convolution.\n\n47\n00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000\nLet's now assume the robot senses again, and for the sake of the argument,\n\n48\n00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000\nlet's assume it sees itself right next to a door again,\n\n49\n00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000\nso the measurement is the same as before.\n\n50\n00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000\nNow the most amazing thing happens.\n\n51\n00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000\nWe end up multiplying our belief, which is now prior to the second measurement,\n\n52\n00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000\nwith a function that looks very much like this one over here,\n\n53\n00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000\nwhich has a peak at each door and out comes a belief that looks like the following.\n\n54\n00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000\nThere are a couple of minor bumps, but the only really big bump is this one over here.\n\n55\n00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000\nThis one corresponds to this guy over there in the prior, \n\n56\n00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000\nand it's the only place in this prior that really corresponds to the measurement of a door,\n\n57\n00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000\nwhereas all the other places of doors have a low prior belief.\n\n58\n00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000\nAs a result, this function is really interesting.\n\n59\n00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000\nIt's a distribution that focuses most of its weight \n\n60\n00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000\nonto the correct hypothesis of the world being in the second door,\n\n61\n00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000\nand it provides very little belief to places far away from doors.\n\n62\n00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000\nAt this point, our robot has localized itself.\n\n63\n00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000\nIf you understood this, you understand probability, and

It's the uniform distribution.\n\n2\n00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000\nThere's an intuitive reasoning behind this.\n\n3\n00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000\nEvery time we move, we lose information.\n\n4\n00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000\nThat is, in the initial distribution we know exactly where we are.\n\n5\n00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000\nOne step in we have a 0.8 chance, but the 0.8 will fall to something smaller\n\n6\n00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000\nas we move on--0.64 and so on.\n\n7\n00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000\nThe distribution of the absolute least information is the uniform distribution.\n\n8\n00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000\nIt has no preference whatsoever.\n\n9\n00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000\nThat is really the result of moving many, many times.\n\n10\n00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000\nThere is a way to derive this mathematically,\n\n11\n00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000\nand I can prove a property that's highly related, which is a balance property.\n\n12\n00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000\nSay we take x4, and we'd like to understand how x4 at some time sub t\n\n13\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000\ncorresponds to the previous time distribution over all these variables.\n\n14\n00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000\nFor this to be stationary, it has to be the same.\n\n15\n00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:08,000\nPut differently, the probability of x4 must be the same as 0.8p(x2) + 0.1p(x1) + 0.1p(x3).\n\n16\n00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000\nThis is exactly the same calculation we did before where we asked \n\n17\n00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000\nwhat's the chance of being x4.\n\n18\n00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000\nWell, you might be coming from x2, x1, or x3,\n\n19\n00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000\nand as these probabilities are 0.8, 0.1, and 0.1, \n\n20\n00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000\nthey govern the likelihood you might have been coming from there.\n\n21\n00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000\nThose together must hold true in the limit when things don't move anymore.\n\n22\n00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000\nNow, you might think there are many different ways to solve this\n\n23\n00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000\nand the 0.2 is just one solution,\n\n24\n00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000\nbut it turns out 0.2 is the only solution.\n\n25\n00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000\nIf you plug in 0.2 over here and 0.2 over here and 0.2 over here,\n\n26\n00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000\nyou get 1 x 0.2, and that's 0.2 on the right side.\n\n27\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000\nClearly, those 0.2s over here meet the balance that is necessary\n\n28\n00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000\nto define a valid solution in the limit.\n\n", "id": 8016}, "key":

00:00:15,000\nIt is an example that is commonly studied in statistics classes.\n\n5\n00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000\nSuppose there exists a certain type of cancer,\n\n6\n00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000\nbut the cancer is rare--only 1 in a 1000 people has the cancer--\n\n7\n00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000\nwhere as 999 in 1000 people don't have it, \n\n8\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000\nillustrated by the probability of cancer and the probability of not cancer.\n\n9\n00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000\nSupper we have a test, and the test can come out positive or negative.\n\n10\n00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000\nThe probability that the test triggers positive if you have cancer is 0.8,\n\n11\n00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000\nand the probability that the test comes out positive given that I'm cancer free is only 0.1.\n\n12\n00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000\nClearly the test has a strong correlation to whether I have cancer.\n\n13\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000\nHere's a really difficult question. \n\n14\n00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000\nCan you compute for me the probability of cancer given that I just received a positive test.\n\n15\n00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000\nLet me emphasize this is not an easy question, but you should be able,\n\n16\n00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000\nbased on what I've taught you, to calculate this result.\n\n17\n00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000\nThink of the cancer/non cancer as the robot position\n\n18\n00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000\nand think of the positive as whether the colored door

--> 00:00:05,000\nLet's look at motion, which will turn out to be something we will call total probability.\n\n2\n00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000\nYou remember that we cared about a grid cell \"xi,\"\n\n3\n00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000\nand we asked what is the chance of being xi after robot motion?\n\n4\n00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000\nNow, to indicate the after and before, let me add a time index.\n\n5\n00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000\nT up here, is an index for time.\n\n6\n00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000\nI write it superscript so there is no confusion with the index i, which is the grid cell.\n\n7\n00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000\nYou might remember the way we computed this \n\n8\n00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000\nwas by looking at all the grid cells the world could have come from on time step earlier--\n\n9\n00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000\nindexed here by j.\n\n10\n00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000\nWe looked at the prior probability of those grid cells at time t - 1.\n\n11\n00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000\nWe multiply with the probability that our motion command would carry us from xj to xi.\n\n12\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000\nThis is written as a condition distribution as follows.\n\n13\n00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000\nThis was exactly what we implemented.\n\n14\n00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000\nIf there was our grid cells over here \n\n15\n00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000\nand we asked one time step later about a specific grid cell over here,\n\n16\n00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000\nwe would combine 0.8 from over here, 0.1 from over here, and 0.1 from over here\n\n17\n00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000\ninto the probability of this grid cell.\n\n18\n00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000\nIt's the same formula as here. \n\n19\n00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000\nThis is now xi, and the way we find the posterior probability for xi is to go through\n\n20\n00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000\n all possible places from which we could have come, all the different j's.\n\n21\n00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000\nLook at the prior probabilities, multiply it by the probability that I transition from j to i\n\n22\n00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000\ngiven my motion command, which in this case is go 1 to the right side.\n\n23\n00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000\nNow in probability terms, people often write it as follows: \n\n24\n00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000\nP(A) = \u01a9 p(A\u2502B) p(B).\n\n25\n00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000\nThis is just the way you'd find it in text books, \n\n26\n00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000\nand you can see directly the correspondence of A as a place i of time t\n\n27\n00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000\nand all the different Bs as the possible prior locations.\n\n28\n00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000\nThat is often called the Theorem of Total Probability.\n\n29\n00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:01,000\nThe operation of a weighted sum over other variables is often called a \"convolution.\"\n\n", "id": 8030}, "key":

00:00:06,000\n[Andy:] On the forums, we saw a lot of confusion about homeworks 2.5 and 2.6.\n\n2\n00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000\nSpecifically, questions about what was going on with the linear algebra.\n\n3\n00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000\nI want to talk about some of that today, and I want to do it by comparing the 2D case --\n\n4\n00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000\nand that's the case we talked about in lecture--\n\n5\n00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000\nwith the 4D case, which is what you're asked about on the homework.\n\n6\n00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000\nSo in the 2-dimensional case, I want to first talk about this f matrix\n\n7\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000\nthat Sebastian was calling the \"state transition matrix.\"\n\n8\n00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000\nThe idea behind this matrix was that we wanted to take some old beliefs,\n\n9\n00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000\nsome old state, which in the 2-dimensional case was represented by x and \u1e8b\n\n10\n00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000\nwhere \u1e8b is our velocity and x is our position,\n\n11\n00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000\nand from that we want to extract our predict some new state, \n\n12\n00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000\nwhich was called x-prime and \u1e8b-prime.\n\n13\n00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000\nThe question was what do we fill in here to get the proper values for x-prime and \u1e8b-prime.\n\n14\n00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000\nLet's think.\n\n15\n00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000\nWhat should our position be--our predicted position after some time has elapsed?\n\n16\n00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000\nWell, we want to include our old position, right?\n\n17\n00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000\nLets first write out these formulas.\n\n18\n00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000\nWe expect that x-prime will be composed of our old position \n\n19\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000\nplus whatever motion was occurring due to the velocity.\n\n20\n00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000\nThat is going to be dt--the time elapsed--times our velocity.\n\n21\n00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000\nThis is just velocity times time, which tells us how much our position has changed.\n\n22\n00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000\nNow, in matrix terms how do we express that?\n\n23\n00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000\nWe're talking about x-prime, so that means we're going to think about this top row here.\n\n24\n00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000\nWe want to keep x, which means a 1 goes here.\n\n25\n00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000\nWe want to multiply \u1e8b by dt, so that means dt goes here.\n\n26\n00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000\nJust like that we figured out the first row of our F matrix.\n\n27\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000\nI'll label it here--F. Now what about the second row? \n\n28\n00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000\nLet's do a similar thing for \u1e8b prime to figure out where we should go in the second row.\n\n29\n00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000\nAfter our prediction, we said that we're just \n\n30\n00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000\ngoing to assume that the velocity hasn't changed.\n\n31\n00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000\nVelocity after equals velocity before.\n\n32\n00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000\nThat means we don't want to have anything to do with this x, meaning a 0 goes here.\n\n33\n00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000\nWe want everything to do with this \u1e8b--we want to keep this--so we put a 1 here.\n\n34\n00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000\nOkay. This kind of gives us some intuition for how this works in 2 dimensions.\n\n35\n00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000\nLet's see if we can generalize to 4.\n\n36\n00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000\nNow, again, we're going to some new state, \n\n37\n00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000\nand we're doing that by multiplying a state-transition matrix by some old belief.\n\n38\n00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000\nBut now instead of x and \u1e8b, we also have y coordinates.\n\n39\n00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000\nSo we have x, y, \u1e8b, and \u1e8f.\n\n40\n00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000\nHere we're going to, of course, get x, y, \u1e8b, \u1e8f, and all of those are prime,\n\n41\n00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000\nbecause they indicate after our prediction.\n\n42\n00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000\nNow, I'm not going to fill in this 4 x 4 matrix for you, \n\n43\n00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000\nbut I think using similar reasoning to what we did in the 2-dimensional case,\n\n44\n00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000\nyou can come up with what these formulas should be,\n\n45\n00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000\nand from that fill in this matrix appropriately,\n\n46\n00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000\nremembering that this entry corresponds to the first row,\n\n47\n00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000\nthis entry the second, and so on.

Where does it come from? How do we get it in real life?\n\n38\n00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000\nWhat are we doing with our sensors?\n\n39\n00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000\nSo the noise matrices express how noisy your sensor is,\n\n40\n00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000\nand at first approximation you'd say let's just measure\n\n41\n00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000\n what the variation of the measurement is and then plug it in.\n\n42\n00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000\nBut because these filters, a very subtle thing, assume conditional independence,\n\n43\n00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000\nthey assume that noise is independent from one type to the next whereas in reality it isn't.\n\n44\n00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000\nTypically you start with a very large value, and you look a the result,\n\n45\n00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000\nand if the result looks good to you, you leave it that way.\n\n46\n00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000\nUnfortunately, there is no good science for it.\n\n47\n00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000\nAwhile back, together with Andrew Ng, I published a paper \n\n48\n00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000\non how to learn the noise matrix, but that goes way beyond this class.\n\n49\n00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000\nYou mentioned that Stanley and Junior both use laser and radar.\n\n50\n00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000\nDoes each one offer something unique or are the both just doing the same thing?\n\n51\n00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000\nEither way, how do we incorporate measurements from 2 sources into our Kalman filter?\n\n52\n00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000\nThese are two questions.\n\n53\n00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000\nFirst of all, laser and radar at first approximation do the same thing.\n\n54\n00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000\nThey measure how far things are away.\n\n55\n00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000\nRadar also measures how fast they're moving for the Doppler effect,\n\n56\n00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000\nbut their characteristics are very different. They measure different things.\n\n57\n00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000\nThere are certain things that can only be measured by laser, others just by radar.\n\n58\n00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000\nIn fact, laser tends to have much higher spatial resolution,\n\n59\n00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000\nbut events become foggy. \n\n60\n00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000\nThe wavelength of light tends not to be as good as a radar wavelength.\n\n61\n00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000\nSo they're somewhat complementary. \n\n62\n00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000\nTo incorporate both, Bayes rule allows you to incorporate sensor measurements one after another.\n\n63\n00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000\nIf you have a laser and a radar, you just multiply both of them in, and that's just fine.\n\n64\n00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000\nOkay, great.\n\n65\n00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000\nThe top-rated question, actually, was about \n\n66\n00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000\nthe programming languages used in Stanley and Junior.\n\n67\n00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000\nWas it Python? Was it something else? >>It was not Python, honestly. >>Okay.\n\n68\n00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000\nAt the time, we started out with C, but then C++ became very popular. I was popular.\n\n69\n00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000\nAnd it was the better choice, so almost all the code is written in C++/\n\n70\n00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000\nHow do you make that decision when you're starting a project this big? Is there debate?\n\n71\n00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000\nThere is always debate.\n\n72\n00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000\nThe beauty of C++ is it is very efficient in execution,\n\n73\n00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000\nand when you use it right it can be very powerful. If you don't abuse it.\n\n74\n00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000\nIt has way too many things built in, but some of the things like the classes are just really, really good.\n\n75\n00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000\nThen you hire people, and you work with students, and some of them like Java,\n\n76\n00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000\nso they write their code in Java, and others like C++ or Python or Ruby on Rails.\n\n77\n00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000\nThen you just bring all the stuff together.\n\n78\n00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000\nOkay--thinking of Stanley and Junior, \n\n79\n00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000\nwhat were the major hardware and software differences between the two vehicles?\n\n80\n00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000\nStanley had about 6 embedded processors.\n\n81\n00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000\nJunior had 2 PCs with quad cores so there was a more integrated system.\n\n82\n00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000\nThe biggest difference in the hardware was really the sensors.\n\n83\n00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000\nStanley had very, very cheap and simple laser-range finders as the main sensor.\n\n84\n00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000\nWe did have radars. We didn't use them much.\n\n85\n00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000\nWhereas Junior had a much more ranging sensor suite. \n\n86\n00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000\nJunior could look in all directions--we call this \"surround sensing\"--\n\n87\n00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000\nwhereas Stanley could only look straight ahead.\n\n88\n00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000\nSo that thing we saw spinning on the top of Stanley, that was the laser-range finder?\n\n89\n00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000\nWhat you saw spinning on the top of Stanley was actually on Junior.\n\n90\n00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000\nThat was on Junior--okay.\n\n91\n00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000\nYeah, you never saw anything on Stanley, because there's nothing spinning there.\n\n92\n00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000\nThat was on Junior, and that was a laser-range finder.\n\n93\n00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000\nRight, and that one spins because it looks in all directions.\n\n94\n00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000\nThat was important for city driving because what's behind you actually matters in cities\n\n95\n00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000\nwhereas if you drive in desert terrain there is no traffic. You don't have to look back.\n\n96\n00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000\nThat's a good segue into the next question, which is what's the next big challenge?\n\n97\n00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000\nWe've done deserts. We've done urban driving.\n\n98\n00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000\nThe next challenge is it'll take over our cars.\n\n99\n00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000\nBasically get this technology into every single car and make sure driving is safe.\n\n100\n00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000\nEvery person has a special button that says, like I explained, my little chauffeur button.\n\n101\n00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000\nI want to just drive automatically, \n\n102\n00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000\nand then I'm just going to get home without having to pay attention.\n\n103\n00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000\nFinally, how comfortable is it? \n\n104\n00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000\nDo these cars drive similar to the way you or I would drive?\n\n105\n00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000\nWhen we first started out, I would say the driving is effective but not elegant.\n\n106\n00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000\nYou would get in the car, and you'd know exactly what I mean.\n\n107\n00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000\nThe steering wheel would go like this all the time, and it would make a lot of noise.\n\n108\n00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000\nIt was pretty clear you were inside a robot.\n\n109\n00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000\nOn the outside it looked pretty great, but on the inside it didn't.\n\n110\n00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000\nBut as things moved on, if you get into a Google car right now, \n\n111\n00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000\nyou won't be able to distinguish from a human driver. It's really rock solid.\n\n112\n00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000\nThe steering wheel stays like this, but it turns it confidentally drags it around, \n\n113\n00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000\nmoves the right direction, comes back. It's actually come a long way.\n\n114\n00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000\nTo get from what you said to where we are now--was it low-pass filtering?\n\n115\n00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000\nWe will have a class on control, \n\n116\n00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,000\nand the control techniques ended up to be very sophisticated but also very, very good.\n\n117\n00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000\nAll the motion of the steering wheel are all related to inaccuracies.\n\n118\n00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000\nThey came from multiple sources.\n\n119\n00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000\nSome of it was that we weren't processing our GPS date good enough yet and our map data.\n\n120\n00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000\nSome of it was the map resolution--like if you have a 10-15 cm grid cell\n\n121\n00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000\nand your estimate jumps from 1 grid cell to the next or your particle filter jumps a little bit around.\n\n122\n00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000\nThey might not look dramatic on a screen, but if you turned to steering motion\n\n123\n00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000\nin your steering wheel, it goes by 2 or 3 or 4 degrees. That's really bad.\n\n124\n00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000\nWe had a sensor that tracks that angle of the steering wheel and the spatial resolution was about a degree.\n\n125\n00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000\nThat means you couldn't quite know what the angle was, \n\n126\n00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000\nso you would drive a little blind--like up to a degree.\n\n127\n00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000\nA degree of steering wheel doesn't sound like much, but it's actually a lot.\n\n128\n00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000\nYou can try this out. \n\n129\n00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000\nIf you drive a car and you only move it by a degree, you feel a noticeable effect.\n\n130\n00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000\nYou'd find out after a while we'll actually pulling in this direction. Let's drag it back.\n\n131\n00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000\nAnd all that stuff we kind of fixed.\n\n132\n00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000\nSo we'll learn about that in, I think, Unit 5? PIT controllers? >>Yep.\n\n133\n00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000\nExcellent. I can't wait. >> All right. >>Thanks a lot. >>All right.

00:00:07,000\nIn class you already programmed a particle filter for a really simplistic robot\n\n3\n00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000\nthat was able to measure ranges to landmarks and moved pretty much like a trashbin.\n\n4\n00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000\nNow I'd like replace it with a more interesting robot that's more realistic.\n\n5\n00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000\nIn particular, I'd like you to use a car. Here's a car.\n\n6\n00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000\nA car tends to have fixed tires and two steerable in the front.\n\n7\n00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000\nSuppose the location of our car in a coordinate system \n\n8\n00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000\nis given by its x-coordinate and its y-coordinate--\n\n9\n00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000\nI'm picking the halfway point on the rear axle as the reference point--\n\n10\n00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000\nand by its heading dire theta.\n\n11\n00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000\nThe state will be x, y, and the orientation theta.\n\n12\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000\nThen this car also has a steering angle that is called the alpha.\n\n13\n00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000\nThe question is how is the state effected by driving a certain distance d\n\n14\n00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000\nwith a fixed steering angle, assuming the initial state is x, y, and theta.\n\n15\n00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000\nIt turns out to answer this, I also need to know the length of the vehicle,\n\n16\n00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000\nwhich I will just call L for length that is a constant throughout out consideration.\n\n17\n00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000\nThis is usually called a bicycle model.\n\n18\n00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000\nObviously, it suffices to look at one pair of tires because the other one--\n\n19\n00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000\nat least in approximation--runs pretty much parallel.\n\n20\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000\nIf we look at the robot locally where we have a steering angle, alpha,\n\n21\n00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000\nrobot length L, and we're driving the rear tire forward by distance D,\n\n22\n00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000\nthen the robot will turn to the left, and it's turning angle, beta, is proportional\n\n23\n00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000\n to the distance that the rear tire moves forward divided by the length of the vehicle\n\n24\n00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000\ntimes the tangent of the steering angle.\n\n25\n00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000\nLet's now compute the changes of x, y, and theta in the local coordinate system.\n\n26\n00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000\nRealize the turning radius R of this robot \n\n27\n00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000\nis simply the distance that we drive forward divided by beta.\n\n28\n00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000\nIt's relatively simple math, which I don't want to explain in detail.\n\n29\n00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000\nThis means that the robot is turning around a point over here at cx and cy.\n\n30\n00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000\nAfter the turn, the vehicle is located somewhere over here.\n\n31\n00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000\nIn global coordinates, here is the way we describe this.\n\n32\n00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000\nCx is the x coordinate of the robot x minus--now we go to the left--\n\n33\n00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000\nthe sine of the robot orientation before motion times radius R.\n\n34\n00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,000\nSimilarly, cy is this expression over here--y plus cosine of the orientation times R.\n\n35\n00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000\nThen after motion, we can go back from cx to cy to a new state over here\n\n36\n00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000\nsimply by adding in the turning radius beta.\n\n37\n00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000\nThat is, our new x is cx plus sine of theta plus beta times radius.\n\n38\n00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000\nNotice how this parallels this guy over here, except for two changes.\n\n39\n00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000\nWhat we previously subtracted we're now adding,\n\n40\n00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000\nand we're adding beta to the argument of the sine.\n\n41\n00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000\nThe same with y, and the orientation is just increased by beta--modulo 2\u03c0.\n\n42\n00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000\nThis all works if the robot is actually turning.\n\n43\n00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000\nIf the robot were to go straight, then R would become infinity by this division over here.\n\n44\n00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,000\nFor small betas--that's smaller than 0.001--we can approximate this all as straight motion.\n\n45\n00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000\nOur new x is the old x times our driven distance pointed in the cosine of the heading direction.\n\n46\n00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000\nSimilarly for y we go in sine of heading direction, and the heading direction stays the same.\n\n47\n00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000\nYou could add beta, which is basically zero, to be slight more precise\n\n48\n00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000\nor you could just use theta. It doesn't really matter.\n\n49\n00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000\nIn this programming assignment, I'd like you to implement this piece \n\n50\n00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000\nof math over here in our particle filter.\n\n51\n00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:57,000\nTo make sure we increment it correctly, I will give you some example data that you can check.\n\n52\n00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000\nIn our first part, I've prepared a lot of software for you,\n\n53\n00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000\nbasically copying the old particle filter software over, \n\n54\n00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000\nand removing the motion and the measurement model for now.\n\n55\n00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000\nIn this I just want you to practice the motion model.\n\n56\n00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000\nWe assume a length of the road of 20.\n\n57\n00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000\nWe initialize the road with this length parameter, \n\n58\n00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000\nand for this first iteration we assume no steering noise and no distance noise.\n\n59\n00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000\nI set the robot to (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) in the beginning, \n\n60\n00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000\nand then I cache away a number of motions, \n\n61\n00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000\nThe way to read those is this robot is moving by 10 total with the steering angle of zero.\n\n62\n00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000\nThen it moves another 10 with a steering angle of pi divided by 6.\n\n63\n00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000\nThen it moves 20, again with a steering angle of zero.\n\n64\n00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000\nA pi over 6 is a left steering,\n\n65\n00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000\nso the robot should change its coordinates in the beginning just in the x direction, \n\n66\n00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000\nbecause it's facing an x direction over here.\n\n67\n00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000\nThen turn left a little bit, go forward, and go straight again.\n\n68\n00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000\nScrolling down a little bit, I also give you the code to run the robot.\n\n69\n00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000\nWe've created the robot here. You print the initial coordinate.\n\n70\n00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000\nThen for each of the motions in this list over here,\n\n71\n00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000\nwe apply the myrobot equals myrobot.move command,\n\n72\n00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000\nand we print out the successive command.\n\n73\n00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000\nIf you get this right, these are the numbers I would like to see.\n\n74\n00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000\nInitially, the robot position is 0, 0, 0, 0. That's just the one over here.\n\n75\n00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000\nIt's out first print command. It then moves forward in the x direction by 10.\n\n76\n00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000\nThe orientation stays 0 and so does y, because there's no steering.\n\n77\n00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000\nNow we steer. This affects x. It doesn't quite move 10. It only moves 9.86. \n\n78\n00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000\nIn the y direction it only moves 1.433, and its new orientation is 0.2886.\n\n79\n00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000\nThen we move straight again, and now the x coordinate becomes 0.3903,\n\n80\n00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000\ny coordinate becomes 7.12, orientation 0.28.\n\n81\n00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000\nYour code should output exactly the same values also over here.\n\n82\n00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000\nJust to give you a second test--this is a sequence of 10 motions\n\n83\n00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000\nwhere the robot moves 10 forward and always turns right but an angle of 0.2 in radians.\n\n84\n00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000\nWe look at the outputs we get the following array.\n\n85\n00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000\nYou can see that the orientation starting at zero, which is the same as 2\u03c0,\n\n86\n00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000\ndecreases all the way to 5.26, \n\n87\n00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000\nand you can also see that the robot starts running in a circle\n\n88\n00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000\nwhereas initially we add almost 10 to the x direction and almost nothing in the y direction.\n\n89\n00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000\nAs you come down here, we subtract quite a bit in the y direction,\n\n90\n00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000\nbecause now the robot is going in a circle.\n\n91\n00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000\nYou should look at these numbers over here and see if your code matches\n\n92\n00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000\n these exact numbers that my code outputs.\n\n", "id": 241001}, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GIHWDQwLEgZOdWdnZXQY0eIODA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/224001/Nugget/242001", "type": "Nugget", "id": 242001}, {"nuggetType": "program", "name": "Circular Motion", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cjMLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GIHWDQw", "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GIHWDQwLEgZOdWdnZXQYofIODA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/224001/Nugget/244001", "suppliedCode": "\n# -----------------\n# USER INSTRUCTIONS\n#\n# Write a function in the class robot called move()\n#\n# that takes self and a motion vector (this\n# motion vector contains a steering* angle and a\n# distance) as input and returns an instance of the class\n# robot with the appropriate x, y, and orientation\n# for the given motion.\n#\n# *steering is defined in the video\n# which accompanies this problem.\n#\n# For now, please do NOT add noise to your move function.\n#\n# Please do not modify anything except where indicated\n# below.\n#\n# There are test cases which you are free to use at the\n# bottom.

00:00:03,000\nHere's a function \"move\" as a class function of the class robot\n\n2\n00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000\nthat implements where I get my motion vector,\n\n3\n00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000\nand the motion vector is defined to be steering first, then distance.\n\n4\n00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000\nI have a few error checks here to make sure the steering doesn't exceed \n\n5\n00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000\nthe max steering angle, and the same is true for distance.\n\n6\n00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000\nI want it to be non-negative.\n\n7\n00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000\nAs I go down, I now implement the motion model.\n\n8\n00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000\nLet's just look a little bit more.\n\n9\n00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000\nI make a new robot copy as in my sample code in class.\n\n10\n00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000\nI copy all the narrowing parameters--length, bearing noise, steering noise, and distance noise.\n\n11\n00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000\nNothing surprising here.\n\n12\n00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000\nHere I'll apply the noise, which you don't need it for the first implementation, \n\n13\n00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000\nbut later on as we go on, you need it to actually add noise.\n\n14\n00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000\nI just add Gaussian noise with the corresponding steering noise and distance noise parameters.\n\n15\n00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000\nIf I set the mean of the Gaussian to be the steering command \n\n16\n00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000\nand the distance command then this adds noise.\n\n17\n00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000\nI could have equally written steering plus random.gauss, \n\n18\n00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000\nzero, comma, and then the noise parameter.\n\n19\n00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000\nAs I go down further, here is my execution of motion.\n\n20\n00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000\nMy turning angle, I called \"turn.\"\n\n21\n00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000\nThis is the tangents of the noisy steering \n\n22\n00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000\ntimes the distance moved divided by the robot length.\n\n23\n00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000\nAs in my explanation of this question, I'm going to branch and see if my turn is significant enough.\n\n24\n00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000\nIt's smaller than tolerance, and tolerance was set about to 0.001.\n\n25\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000\nThen I just model a straight motion. \n\n26\n00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000\nI get my new robot coordinates by the old robot coordinates,\n\n27\n00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000\nmoving in the orientation of the robot--cosine for x and sine for y.\n\n28\n00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000\nI increase my orientation by turn, which is likely essentially zero.\n\n29\n00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000\nIn case I go beyond 0 or 2\u03c0,\n\n30\n00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000\nI do the modal operation here just to make sure my angles are nicely between 0 and 2\u03c0.\n\n31\n00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000\nThe more interesting case--as we go down \n\n32\n00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000\nin this program you can see that I now calculate the radius \n\n33\n00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000\nas the noise distance divided by turning.\n\n34\n00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000\nThen I find the center of the circle around which I'm turning, \n\n35\n00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000\nusing the exact same math I just gave you. \n\n36\n00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000\nI now first change the orientation to be the new orientation \n\n37\n00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000\nby adding turn to the old orientation, modal, or 2\u03c0.\n\n38\n00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000\nThen I plug the new orientation into the sine and cosine argument, \n\n39\n00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000\nmultiply by radius, add to the center of the circle to get my result.\n\n40\n00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000\nThis routine over here gives me exactly what I wanted.\n\n", "id": 245001}, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GIHWDQwLEgZOdWdnZXQYivoODA", "path":

want you to put everything together and build a particle filter.\n\n3\n00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000\nI'm supplying you with code that has as gaps \n\n4\n00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000\npretty much the 2 functions you just programmed--move and sense,\n\n5\n00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000\nand some additional code that I copied from class--\n\n6\n00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000\nthe particle filter code that you're familiar with and also code \n\n7\n00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000\nthat helps you test your routines so you can make sure they're correct.\n\n8\n00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000\nThe key new thing you have to do is you have to work on the noise.\n\n9\n00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000\nThere is now bearing noise and steering noise and distance noise.\n\n10\n00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000\nThe code that you wrote didn't have any of those.\n\n11\n00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000\nI want you now to modify your procedures to accommodate this noise--\n\n12\n00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000\nsteering noise, distance noise, and bearing noise--\n\n13\n00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000\nand all of it should be Gaussian.\n\n14\n00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000\nLet's go all the way to the end. There are two test cases.\n\n15\n00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000\nThe first test case, which are uncommented so we can run it.\n\n16\n00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000\nWhat this is is it creates a sequence of robot motions.\n\n17\n00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000\nAt each of these time steps the robot turns a little bit and moves forward.\n\n18\n00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000\nIt also has 8 measurements, which are the bearings to the those 4 different landmarks.\n\n19\n00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000\nIf I go up a little bit in the code, \n\n20\n00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000\nthen you'll find that the ground true final position was 93, 75, and 5.2.\n\n21\n00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000\nWhen I run it, it runs the routine particle filter with those motions \n\n22\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000\nand those measurements as an input.\n\n23\n00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000\nIt produces an estimate, which is 94, 71, and 5.2,\n\n24\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000\nwhich isn't exactly the same as up here, but it's close.\n\n25\n00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000\nThis is a particle filter working.\n\n26\n00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000\nI'm supplying quite a few functions for you. You should look around.\n\n27\n00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000\nOne is called particle filters. \n\n28\n00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000\nThat's exactly the same code we used in class and constructed together.\n\n29\n00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000\n I just copied it over, so if you look through this you'll find, hopefully, no surprise here.\n\n30\n00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000\nI'm also supplying you the measurement probability function, which is part of implementation.\n\n31\n00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000\nLets just go there.\n\n32\n00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000\nHere is the measurement probability function. There is something non-trivial here.\n\n33\n00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000\nI compute the predicted measurements, \n\n34\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000\nand then I compute a Gaussian that measures the distance between \n\n35\n00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000\nthe measurements passed into the routine \n\n36\n00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000\nand the predicted measurements computer over here.\n\n37\n00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000\nThat's all happening down here. Here's my Gaussian function with the exponential.\n\n38\n00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000\nThen I return my Gaussian error. There should be no surprise here.\n\n39\n00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000\nWhat's important is a little modification to the sense function that we haven't seen before.\n\n40\n00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000\nI can now give the sense function a parameter, and I give it the parameter 0.\n\n41\n00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000\nIt switches off the noise model, so you will need the noise model \n\n42\n00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000\nfor forward simulation of the robot, \n\n43\n00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000\nbut you don't need it for computing the probability of the measurement.\n\n44\n00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000\nIt augments your sense function to have a flag\n\n45\n00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000\n that if it's set to 0 it switches off the noise modeling \n\n46\n00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000\nand gets you the predicted best possible measurements.\n\n47\n00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000\nWhat you have to do is you have to find the part in the code\n\n48\n00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000\n that says \"only add/modify code below here.\"\n\n49\n00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000\nYou have to copy over your move function and then work in,\n\n50\n00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000\nas it says in the instructions, the steering noise and the distance noise \n\n51\n00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000\nand it's Gaussian--I hope you know how to do this.\n\n52\n00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000\nThen you also have to plug in the sense function, \n\n53\n00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000\nand you also have to plug in bearing noise and make sure there's \n\n54\n00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000\na flag that allows you to switch off the bearing noise. \n\n55\n00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000\nIt should be an optional flag,\n\n56\n00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000\nso it has to have a default value of the bearing noise being on.\n\n57\n00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000\nOtherwise your code won't run.\n\n58\n00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000\nHere is how we will test your code.\n\n59\n00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000\nIf you go to test case number 2, \n\n60\n00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000\nthen I wrote a few extra functions for you that allow you to test your particle filters \n\n61\n00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000\non many, many instances just like the ones we were using \n\n62\n00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000\nfor testing that are all randomly generated.\n\n63\n00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000\nLet me just go through that code line-by-line.\n\n64\n00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000\nOur test case will be 8 steps long.\n\n65\n00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000\nThere is the same motions vector we had before of a slight turn on the circle.\n\n66\n00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000\n\"Generate_ground_truth\" gives us a sequence of measurements and a robot position\n\n67\n00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000\nthat we can split as follows, using a robot simulation.\n\n68\n00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000\nThen you run your particle filter over here, and the function \n\n69\n00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000\n\"check_output\" down here compares the final robot position, the ground truth position,\n\n70\n00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000\nwith your particle filter position, estimated position, from here \n\n71\n00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000\nand gives us a single flag whether this is all correct. Let me just do this.\n\n72\n00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000\nWe generate a robot that finished with final location 20, -29, and this orientation over here.\n\n73\n00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,000\nThe particle filter came up with 22, -31, and 0.14, which is close to the original.\n\n74\n00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000\nMy code check said \"True.\" Let me run it again.\n\n75\n00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,000\nDifferent values--still true. Run it again. Different values--still true.\n\n76\n00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000\nNow, it could happen that the code check says \"False.\"\n\n77\n00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000\nI just ran it 20 times, and it said true for me every single time.\n\n78\n00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000\nBut I've seen it say \"False.\" \n\n79\n00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000\nThe reason is it's a randomized algorithm. It's a particle filter.\n\n80\n00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000\nIt might actually not have a particle at the right place.\n\n81\n00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000\nSo when we test your routine, we're going to code our own code check, check_output.\n\n82\n00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000\nWe have our own function for this, but we're going to run it multiple times.\n\n83\n00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000\nIf you get it wrong once it's not a big deal.\n\n84\n00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000\nIn summary, you will have comment out all the test cases again.\n\n85\n00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000\nAll you have to do is supply the missing function. You can test the correctness yourself.\n\n86\n00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000\nYou can basically grade yourself with this test case over here,\n\n87\n00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000\nbut when you submit it, have those commented out, \n\n88\n00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000\nbecause we have our own test software.\n\n89\n00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000\nAll we're going to test is whether your particle filter gives us a good estimate \n\n90\n00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000\nwhen we choose randomly the initial position \n\n91\n00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000\nof the robots, measurements, motions, and so on.\n\n", "id": 248002}, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GIHWDQwLEgZOdWdnZXQYi_oODA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/224001/Nugget/245003", "type": "Nugget", "id": 245003}, {"nuggetType": "program", "name": "Final", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cjMLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GIHWDQw", "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GIHWDQwLEgZOdWdnZXQY8oEPDA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/224001/Nugget/246002", "suppliedCode": "# --------------\n# USER INSTRUCTIONS\n#\n# Now you will put everything together.\n#\n# First make sure that your sense and move functions\n# work as expected for the test cases provided at the\n# bottom of the previous two programming assignments.\n# Once you are satisfied, copy your sense and move\n# definitions into the robot class on this page, BUT\n# now include noise.\n#\n# A good way to include noise in the sense step is to\n# add Gaussian noise, centered at zero with variance\n# of self.bearing_noise to each bearing.

The tangent of this angle is equal to the opposite side,\n\n24\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000\nwhich is the length, over the adjacent side, which is the radius.\n\n25\n00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000\nSo tangent of alpha is equal to L over r. \n\n26\n00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000\nWe manipulate this equation a little bit, and we find that the radius of curvature\n\n27\n00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000\n is equal to the length of the vehicle over the tangent of the steering angle.\n\n", "id": 235004}, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GKuWEAwLEgZOdWdnZXQYm8UQDA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/265003/Nugget/271003", "type": "Nugget", "id": 271003}]}, {"name": "Office Hours 3", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cicLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgw", "type": "Unit", "evaluated": false, "closedAt": "", "nuggetLayout": [[{"nugget_key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GOetEAwLEgZOdWdnZXQY9PsQDA"}]], "availableAt": "", "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cjMLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GOetEAw", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/268007", "open": false, "id": 268007, "nuggets": [{"nuggetType": "lecture", "name": "Office Hours Week 3", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cjMLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GOetEAw", "media": {"dotsub_id": "a95d2c4f-90ca-4780-9575-f1e19c26db4f", "name": "cs373_oo3_00_l_Office-Hours-Week-3", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1chELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDA", "type": "Media", "youtube_failure_reason": null, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ch4LEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSBU1lZGlhGP2iEQw", "youtube_id": "lqRbVMUP9U4", "youtube_state": "done", "path": "Course/cs373/Media/283005", "transcript": "\ufeff1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000\nHello and welcome to the third office hours. Let's jump right in. >>All right.\n\n2\n00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000\nMany students, myself included, had some questions about the resampling wheel.\n\n3\n00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000\nSpecifically, when you draw a random number between 0 and twice W max, \n\n4\n00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000\nwhere did that number, twice W max, come from?\n\n5\n00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000\nI have the same question. I made it up.\n\n6\n00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000\nI wanted to make sure that these wheel can jump over entire particles\n\n7\n00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000\nthat wouldn't large enough, but if you make it really large then you have to search a lot.\n\n8\n00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000\nI figured if it's 2^n it's going to be fine.\n\n9\n00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000\nDoes this bias the sample in any way, choosing this number.\n\n10\n00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000\nI actually don't know.\n\n11\n00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000\n I think there is certainly a correlation between adjacent particles in the selection of particles.\n\n12\n00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000\nThey're not independently drawn.\n\n13\n00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000\nI just don't know what the effect on the particle filter will be, and I wish I did.\n\n14\n00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000\nThe next question, or two questions I should say, come from George.\n\n15\n00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000\nHe wants to know if there are any rules of thumb that we should keep in mind\n\n16\n00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000\nwhen we're choosing what filter to use for a given situation.\n\n17\n00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000\nWhen do we use the particle filter? When do we use the Kalman filter?\n\n18\n00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000\nAbsolutely, yes.\n\n19\n00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000\nThe particle filter is the easiest to implement, but the complexity scales exponentially\n\n20\n00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000\nwith the number of dimensions.\n\n21\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000\nThat's usually a problem, because if you have a high-dimensional space, you just can't apply it.\n\n22\n00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000\nThe Kalman filter is the only filter that does scale exponentially, so it's very nice.\n\n23\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000\nIf you have like a 15-dimensional space, you will usually use a particle filter,\n\n24\n00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000\nbut the problem with the Kalman filter is it's unimodal, so you can't really have multiple hypotheses.\n\n25\n00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000\nThere are extensions of the Kalman filter that does this \n\n26\n00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000\ncalled mixed rough Kalman filter, multihypothesis Kalman filter that can do this.\n\n27\n00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000\nThey address some of these problems.\n\n28\n00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000\nThe histogram filter is applicable in situations similar to the particle filter\n\n29\n00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000\nwhere you have a global uncertainty, and it's more systematic.\n\n30\n00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000\nIn the particle filter, if you loose track of the correct hypothesis, you might never regain it.\n\n31\n00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000\nIn a grid-based filter you have a chance of regaining it.\n\n32\n00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000\nGrids are easily supported in many programming frameworks.\n\n33\n00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000\nSometimes there are better ones to use, but they also have a generic limitation \n\n34\n00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000\nin the accuracy, which is related to the resolution of the grid.\n\n35\n00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000\nMy recommendation is if you have a multimodal distribution use particle filters if you can.\n\n36\n00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000\nIf it's really a continuous space with a unimodal distribution use Kalman filters.\n\n37\n00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000\nOkay. That's a great segue this question about switching between filters on the fly.\n\n38\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000\nFor example, we have our particle filters that converges to a unimodal distribution.\n\n39\n00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000\nThen can we switch to the Kalman filter?\n\n40\n00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000\nIt isn't done much that people switch.\n\n41\n00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000\nThe reason is when you switch between filters,\n\n42\n00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000\nyou end up getting moments of increased uncertainty.\n\n43\n00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000\nYou can see this when you buy commercial GPS receivers.\n\n44\n00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000\nThey tend to run multiple Kalman filters, it turns out, 3D\n\n45\n00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000\ndepending on whether it's 2D or navigation. \n\n46\n00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000\nWhen they are switched, the behavior becomes a little bit iffy, and often that is bad for robots,\n\n47\n00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000\nbecause they they a little bit because this is where it says this thing versus the other thing.\n\n48\n00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000\nThey're not quite consistent.\n\n49\n00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000\nThere are ways to combine multiple filters types.\n\n50\n00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000\nThe most common one is called the Rao-Blackwellized filter--Rao-Blackwellized--\n\n51\n00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000\nafter Rao and Blackwell.\n\n52\n00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000\nWhat they found is that in a particle domain, sometimes if we nail certain dimensions with particles,\n\n53\n00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000\neverything else conditional on the particle becomes Gaussian or unimodal.\n\n54\n00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000\nThen you can exploit the efficiency of a Kalman filter that is now attached to individual particles.\n\n55\n00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000\nI'm not going to go into depth here, but there's an entire field of Rao-Blackwellized filters\n\n56\n00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000\nthat sometimes can estimate in the spaces of hundreds of dimensions.\n\n57\n00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000\nGreat. Thank you. That actually predicted George's next question, so we'll move on.\n\n58\n00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000\nDrew wanted to know about what happens to a particle filter when the motion modal\n\n59\n00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000\nmoves a particle into an invalid place.\n\n60\n00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000\nFor an example, in that corridor demonstration you gave, what if a particle gets moved into a wall?\n\n61\n00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000\nWell, thanks Drew. Great question. \n\n62\n00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000\nThe obvious answer is you killed that particle.\n\n63\n00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000\nThe way to think about this is in the measurement model you've got to have \n\n64\n00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000\n this kind of implicit sensor that says, \"I'm just sitting inside a wall.\"\n\n65\n00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000\nThe truth is the robot never sits inside a wall, so that sensor would always say \n\n66\n00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000\nwith absolute certainty, \"I'm not sitting in the middle of a wall.\"\n\n67\n00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000\nThis kind of hypothetical sensor would justify \n\n68\n00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000\nthat the weight of that particle that's in the middle of the wall would get weight 0, so you just kill it.\n\n69\n00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000\nOkay. A couple more questions from Drew.\n\n70\n00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000\nWhat about dynamically adjusting our big end, our number of particles\n\n71\n00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000\nwhen we want to trade off between computational cost versus the accuracy of our filter?\n\n72\n00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000\nDynamically setting the number of particles has been done quite a bit, \n\n73\n00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000\nand it's a good idea under certain circumstances.\n\n74\n00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000\nObviously, the fewer particles you have the faster you can compute.\n\n75\n00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000\nIf you're tracking really well and all the particles are centered in one location,\n\n76\n00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000\nthere isn't really a need to have as many around as when you're globally uncertain.\n\n77\n00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000\nThey way to set the number of particles is often done by looking \n\n78\n00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000\nat the total non-normalized importance weights.\n\n79\n00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000\nIf all your importance weights are really large, then you're probably doing a great job tracking,\n\n80\n00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000\nand you don't need that many particles.\n\n81\n00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000\nWhereas if your importance weights are all very small, \n\n82\n00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000\nthen chances are you're doing a really lousy job tracking, and you need more particles.\n\n83\n00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000\nThat isn't perfect. An unlikely measurement can cause weights to be small,\n\n84\n00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000\nbut a good heuristic would be to say, let's particle sample \n\n85\n00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000\nuntil our non-normalized importance weights reach a certain threshold,\n\n86\n00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000\nand then let's stop sampling.\n\n87\n00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000\nNow truth telling, many of the systems we're dealing with are real-time systems,\n\n88\n00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000\nand you can't really afford using many particles sometimes and few other times,\n\n89\n00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000\nbecause there's a fixed amount of time in which you want to do your estimates.\n\n90\n00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000\nThen yes, it's more tricky, but in principle using few particles when you track well\n\n91\n00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000\nis a very viable solution.\n\n92\n00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000\nThank you. Taka also had a question.\n\n93\n00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000\nHe wants to know how to distinguish between moving landmarks and non-moving landmarks.\n\n94\n00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000\nThe maps that we dealt with in class were all static, and the landmarks were fixed.\n\n95\n00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000\nHow does the Google car distinguish between these moving vehicles, \n\n96\n00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000\nmoving people, and these static landmarks?\n\n97\n00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000\nThat's a wonderful question.\n\n98\n00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000\nFirst of all, the Google car assumes that the ground map,\n\n99\n00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000\nlike the surface map of the street, is basically fixed.\n\n100\n00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000\nIf lane markers would move along a little bit, then the Google car would probably get confused--\n\n101\n00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000\na little secret here--so please don't repaint the lane markers when the Google car comes by.\n\n102\n00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000\nThat's treated differently than stuff that sticks out of the ground,\n\n103\n00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000\nand even that is used as a landmark.\n\n104\n00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:32,000\nWhat we do is we have a probabilistic threshold that says what's the chance of this thing being mobile or not?\n\n105\n00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000\nWe do this by establishing correspondence, which means we take measurements a time step earlier\n\n106\n00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000\nand measurements a time step later, see which has the most likely \n\n107\n00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000\ncorrespondence between these two measurements \n\n108\n00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000\nand then see if there's a motion vector in between.\n\n109\n00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000\nSometimes we can explain it away by just noise, but for cars and people and so on,\n\n110\n00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000\nthere is very often a very clear and strong motion \n\n111\n00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000\nin which case we assume this thing is moving and tracking.\n\n112\n00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000\nIt also turns out that the way we build our prior maps is sometimes we drive by multiple times.\n\n113\n00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000\nWe do differencing, and then we have most captures are static things in our maps.\n\n114\n00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000\nWe happen to know that in the middle of a street, there tend to be no static things.\n\n115\n00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000\nThere tends to be just moving things.\n\n116\n00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000\nYou can bias the estimate toward saying, well, in the middle of the street\n\n117\n00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000\nwhat we'll see is likely not static.\n\n118\n00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000\nTossing this all together gives us a fairly good tracker.\n\n119\n00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000\nThanks a lot. That's all we had for this time. We'll see you all next week.\n\n120\n00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000\nBut I want to make a comment. \n\n121\n00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000\nI hear that many people really positively received the homework assignment on particle filters,\n\n122\n00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000\nwhich is great. It took me a while to make it.\n\n123\n00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000\nOn the discussion forum there is a posting of a graphical version of it,\n\n124\n00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000\nand I downloaded it. It looks really great.\n\n125\n00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000\nI couldn't get the curser keys to work on my computer, but it's a really great basis to visualize.\n\n126\n00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000\nI think particle filters are really hard to understand without visualization,\n\n127\n00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000\nso I'm really sorry that our current programming environment doesn't provide visualization.\n\n128\n00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000\nI hope in the next round, we'll fix that. I'm pretty sure we'll fix this.\n\n129\n00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000\nSo please play with it.\n\n130\n00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000\nThe other thing I noticed in the discussion boards, and I wanted to just call for feedback,\n\n131\n00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000\nand the same for the Facebook group, that people want harder homework assignments.\n\n132\n00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000\nI'm not sure that's true universally, so if you have an opinion, why don't you just post it.\n\n133\n00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000\nI'd like to get a sense of it.\n\n134\n00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000\nI'm thinking of making an assignment where we toss everything togethera\n\n135\n00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000\nand really build like a mini version of an actual car.\n\n136\n00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000\nThat's going to be really involved, so let me know what you feel like.\n\n137\n00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000\nThis course right now, I would argue, is really Stanford caliber.\n\n138\n00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000\nWhat you guys are doing, and you girls are doing, is really \n\n139\n00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000\nat a quality that I would expect my best Standford students to do.\n\n140\n00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000\nThe type of things you implement, certainly, is at the same pace I would teach at Stanford \n\n141\n00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000\nand possibly faster.\n\n142\n00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000\nBut if I go to a general build-a-robot example, then I'm going to exceed beyond Stanford base.\n\n143\n00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000\nIt's up to you. Let us know.\n\n144\n00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000\nAll right. Keep us posted. I'll be reading the forums. I'm sure Sebastian will too.\n\n145\n00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000\nThank you very much and see you next week.\n\n146\n00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000\nAll right.\n\n", "id": 283005}, "key":

control gains are these parameters tau p, d, and i.\n\n14\n00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000\nNow, this is my favorite part of this class.\n\n15\n00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000\nEvery one of my students has made it through it, and every one of my students \n\n16\n00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000\nis puzzled why I insist on this, but when they implement it they get to love what I'm just about to show you.\n\n17\n00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000\nThe answer is to called \"twiddle.\"\n\n18\n00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000\nTwiddle is my favorite algorithm that I have used in my entire life.\n\n19\n00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000\nSome people call it \"coordinate ascent\" to make it sound a little more sophisticated,\n\n20\n00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000\nbut I just called it twiddle,

00:00:04,000\nHow can we optimize these two terms over here?\n\n2\n00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000\nThe idea is to use grading descent.\n\n3\n00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000\nThat is, every time step we take a small step in the direction of minimizing the error over here.\n\n4\n00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000\nHere's the expression for the first objective.\n\n5\n00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000\nWhen we iterate, we assigned to yi recursively the old yi,\n\n6\n00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000\nbut we subtract a term that's proportional to the deviation of yi to xi,\n\n7\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000\nweighted by a weight function alpha.\n\n8\n00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000\nThat's not exactly the same alpha as before.\n\n9\n00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000\nWe set this alpha over here to 0.5.\n\n10\n00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000\nFor the second term, we could implement this as follows\n\n11\n00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000\nwhere we retain the old y variable, but we move a little bit in the direction of yi+1 and away from yi.\n\n12\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000\nBut an even better implementation looks as follows.\n\n13\n00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000\nThis is combining the step on the left and the step on the right.\n\n14\n00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000\nRealizing that each yi occurs twice in this optimization term,\n\n15\n00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000\none here and one here, we can now go and implement this in a single update rule\n\n16\n00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000\nwhere we wish yi to be as close to yi-1 and simultaneously be as close as yi+1\n\n17\n00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000\nby optimizing this combined term.\n\n18\n00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000\nThink about this as little bit, but that's what I want you to implement.\n\n19\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000\nWe're going to set beta to 0.1.\n\n20\n00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000\nNow let's go and implement this.\n\n21\n00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000\nAs a last hint, I don't want you to apply this optimization for the first or the last node in the sequence.\n\n22\n00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000\nI want those to be unchanged, as we'll see in a second.\n\n23\n00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000\nHere's the code I'll be giving you.\n\n24\n00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000\nThere's a path in a 5 x 5 grid, starting at [0, 0] to [4, 4].\n\n25\n00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000\nIf you look very carefully, it goes to the right at first, then straight down, then to the right again.\n\n26\n00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000\nThis is exactly the path we discussed so far and looks like this graphically.\n\n27\n00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000\nI now want you to implement the function \"smooth,\" which takes as an input the path,\n\n28\n00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000\nour two weighting factors, and a small tolerance variable,\n\n29\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000\nwhich I'll explain to you in a second, and it creates the new path,\n\n30\n00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000\nwhich are the y's in our equations so far from the old path.\n\n31\n00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000\nThis is a deep copy over here.\n\n32\n00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000\nThen below the line, I want you to implement the smoother.\n\n33\n00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000\nWhat the smoother does is iteratively applies the two equations I just gave you to all nodes \n\n34\n00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000\nexcept for the first and the last,\n\n35\n00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000\nand it does so until the total change observed in the update step becomes smaller than tolerance,\n\n36\n00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000\nat which point we consider the smoother to have converged.\n\n37\n00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000\nHere is my command. I compute a new path as a result of the function smooth.\n\n38\n00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000\nIn your test, you should uncomment the \"newpath\" smooth routine\n\n39\n00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000\nand the print routine that outputs my result,\n\n40\n00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:41,000\n \"Thank to EnTeer,\" a student who posted a much better way to output matrices on the discussion forum.\n\n41\n00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000\nI'm going to use his or her code. Thank you so much.\n\n42\n00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000\nHere's the result. After hitting \"Run,\" I have the original path over here--zeros all the way to [4, 4].\n\n43\n00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000\nThe two initial and the end position, should be the same as before, so please don't modify them,\n\n44\n00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000\nbut in between we get these interpolation positions over here.\n\n45\n00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000\nIf you look at this, my original path didn't vary the x's at all for the first three steps\n\n46\n00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000\nwhereas this one goes from [0, 0] to 0.17, so it got closer. It went down a little bit.\n\n47\n00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000\nAlso, it went less to the right side than my original path.\n\n48\n00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000\nWe went all the way to 2 over here to 1.8 over here.\n\n49\n00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000\nWhat this means is that our new points lie a little bit like this.\n\n50\n00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000\nAs you go through the list over here, you'll find that our new points really smooth out \n\n51\n00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000\nthe path to something more like that.\n\n52\n00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000\nNow, just to test this again, I go up and set the weight of the data to 0.\n\n53\n00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000\nHere is a tricky quiz question.\n\n54\n00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000\nSay we set alpha or our data weight to 0, and beta or our smoothing weight to 0.1,\n\n55\n00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000\nand we run this to completion. What do we get?\n\n56\n00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000\nThe original path? The straight line connecting the initial and the final location?\n\n57\n00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000\nOr will everything collapse to a single point?\n\n58\n00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000\nYou can try this out in the RDE before answering this quiz.\n\n", "id": 331002}, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GLG0EwwLEgZOdWdnZXQYu9sTDA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/318001/Nugget/323003", "type": "Nugget", "id": 323003}, {"nuggetType": "quiz", "name": "Proportional Control", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cjMLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GLG0Eww", "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GLG0EwwLEgZOdWdnZXQYvNsTDA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/318001/Nugget/323004", "type": "Nugget", "id": 323004}, {"nuggetType": "lecture", "name": "Systematic Bias Solution", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cjMLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GLG0Eww", "media": {"dotsub_id": "1dd28b6a-ee98-4359-91a9-bc0437032582", "name": "cs373_unit5_11_s_Systematic-Bias", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1chELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDA", "type": "Media", "youtube_failure_reason": null, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ch4LEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSBU1lZGlhGL3bEww", "youtube_id": "luDFEQcJsPc", "youtube_state": "done", "path": "Course/cs373/Media/323005", "transcript": "\ufeff1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000\nOf course it causes a new error.\n\n2\n00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:10,000\nIf I go to my output for 100 steps, I find that the y value is between 0.7 and 0.9.\n\n3\n00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000\nIt really a lot of error.\n\n4\n00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000\nPut differently, the robot oscillates a bit like this with a fairly constant \n\n5\n00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000\nnew offset error due to this bias.\n\n6\n00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000\nEven though the bias was in steering, it manifests itself \n\n7\n00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000\nas an increased crosstrack error in the y direction.\n\n", "id": 323005}, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GLG0EwwLEgZOdWdnZXQYvtsTDA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/318001/Nugget/323006", "type": "Nugget", "id": 323006}, {"nuggetType": "lecture", "name": "Robot Motion Solution", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cjMLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GLG0Eww", "media": {"dotsub_id": "f150cd3f-4fa0-4a17-acf9-2ed2c9ac156f", "name": "cs373_unit5_00_s_Robot-Motion", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1chELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDA", "type": "Media", "youtube_failure_reason": null, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ch4LEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSBU1lZGlhGLnbEww", "youtube_id": "QKAI0xkm41M", "youtube_state": "done", "path": "Course/cs373/Media/323001", "transcript": "\ufeff1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000\nThe answer is subtle.

I'm not going to write it out.\n\n23\n00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000\nWe check whether the error is better than our best error, we retain it, and we multiply dp by 1.1.\n\n24\n00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000\nBut if both of those fail--this one over here and this one over here--\n\n25\n00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:49,000\nwe set p[ i ] back to the original value, and we decrease our probing thing over here,\n\n26\n00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000\nsay, by multiplying it with 0.9.\n\n27\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000\nThat's the core of Twiddle, and what it really does is for each coordinate in isolation\n\n28\n00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000\nit moves our parameter down a little bit by this value over here.\n\n29\n00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000\nIf it then finds a better solution, it retains it, and it even increments the probing interval.\n\n30\n00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000\nIf it fails to find a better solution, it goes back to the original and decreases our probing interval.\n\n31\n00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000\nWe do this entire thing so long as the sum of the dp's is larger than the threshold.\n\n32\n00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:34,000\nSomewhere in here we say while some of dp is larger than 0.00001.\n\n33\n00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000\nIt's hard to read, but I hope you can follow it.\n\n34\n00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000\nThis is Twiddle. Let me put this into pictures.\n\n35\n00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000\nWe have three parameters--0, 0, 0.\n\n36\n00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000\nThen in the first iteration, we bump one of the parameters up and see if it improves the error.\n\n37\n00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000\nIf that's the case, we retain it.\n\n38\n00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000\nThen we go to the second parameter.

00:00:05,000\n[Thrun] So in this next assignment, I'd like you to fix certain data points.\n\n2\n00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000\nJust as much as you fixed the data points originally in our path,\n\n3\n00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000\nthe beginning and end point, now I want to fix you 4 points.\n\n4\n00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000\nThese are the corner points in our data points.\n\n5\n00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000\nIn our original data, it's the one over here, the one over here,\n\n6\n00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000\nand I want those to be fixed so they can't move.\n\n7\n00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000\nAnd the way I indicated this in the code is by giving you a fix array that looks like this\n\n8\n00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000\nwhere each of these numbers corresponds to exactly 1 data point.\n\n9\n00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000\nThere's as many elements in fix as there is in path.\n\n10\n00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000\nAnd then when I call smooth, I add fix as a parameter.\n\n11\n00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000\nSo when you change the procedure and run it,\n\n12\n00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000\nI can tell you you should be surprised by the output\n\n13\n00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000\nin that when I run my procedure it copies over the initial path into the output.\n\n14\n00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000\nWe'll talk about this in a second, but please go ahead and change your procedure\n\n15\n00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000\nso that your output ends up to be giving you something very much like this.\n\n16\n00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000\nThe modification is simple.\n\n17\n00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000\nAs I go through my data points, I only apply the update if it's not fixed.\n\n18\n00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000\nSo if the fix flag is not set, they go in here.\n\n19\n00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000\nThis is all indented one compared to before.\n\n20\n00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000\nIt's a single line change.\n\n21\n00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000\nLet me tell you why this doesn't work.\n\n22\n00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000\nConsider a few data points like these.\n\n23\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000\nIf you fix this data point over here,\n\n24\n00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000\nthen this guy is perfectly happy with his 2 neighbors--\n\n25\n00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000\nthis is a smooth path--\n\n26\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000\nand so is this guy over here.\n\n27\n00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000\nThe only data point that's unhappy is the one over here\n\n28\n00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000\nbecause it's not part of a very smooth path,\n\n29\n00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000\nbut this one is never being updated.\n\n30\n00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000\nSo as a result, all the other ones stay where they are.\n\n31\n00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000\nThey already have the absolute minimum for smoothness and for the data fit.\n\n32\n00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000\nNo updates take change, and we don't have the desired result.\n\n33\n00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000\nWe don't get a nice round curve the way we wish to get it.\n\n34\n00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000\nTo get this, we are going to modify our rule a little bit now, and that's the interesting part.\n\n35\n00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000\nFor a node like this with coordinates xi and yi, \n\n36\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000\nwe add to it with a very small constant gamma--\n\n37\n00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000\nin fact, it will be half our weight smoothing constant in a minute--\n\n38\n00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000\n2 times the previous guy--\n\n39\n00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000\nand of course that's cyclic, so you have to make sure this is really cyclic--\n\n40\n00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000\nminus the guy 2 steps away and minus our node.\n\n41\n00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000\nWhy this makes sense we see when we go into the opposite direction.\n\n42\n00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000\nHere we add a small gamma, 2 times this guy over here minus this guy here\n\n43\n00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000\nminus our original data point.\n\n44\n00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000\nAnd behind this is a certain desire.\n\n45\n00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000\nWe want the vector over here to be the same as the vector over here.\n\n46\n00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000\nThis vector is this difference over here of xi + 1 over yi + 1 - xi over yi.\n\n47\n00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000\nThat is this vector over here.\n\n48\n00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000\nAnd the vector over here is similarly the difference of the point i + 2 \n\n49\n00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000\nminus the same for i + 1.\n\n50\n00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000\nIf you set these to be equal and bring yi to the right side,\n\n51\n00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000\nthen if you modify yi in proportion to this expression over here, we reduce the error.\n\n52\n00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000\nIn fact, the expression in the brackets is the same as this one, called (A),\n\n53\n00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000\nminus this one, called (B).\n\n54\n00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000\nSo we're looking at the mismatch between these 2 vectors\n\n55\n00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000\nand use it to adjust the xi factor over here.\n\n56\n00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000\nWe do those sequentially--this one first, this one second.\n\n57\n00:03:23,000 -->

It has the radius r, which you can set.\n\n8\n00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000\nThe way I'd like to define this racecourse is through a half cycle where we use r,\n\n9\n00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000\nsame half cycle over here, and the stretches in between I want to be 2r long.\n\n10\n00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000\nSo for example, if this radius equals 25 meters, then this would be 50 meters.\n\n11\n00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000\nThe whole thing would be 100 meters, and this measurement would also be 50 meters.\n\n12\n00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000\nI want you to program it such that the initial car is stationed right over here,\n\n13\n00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000\npointed upwards, and then it drives onto the racecourse like this, \n\n14\n00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000\nall the way around infinitely often.\n\n15\n00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000\nThe key in doing this is going to be to set a function.\n\n16\n00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000\nI have already modified for you the function run from our control class\n\n17\n00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000\nto use that crosstrack_error with the parameter radius, \n\n18\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000\nwhich we're going to set to 25, but I can pick a different value in my testing.\n\n19\n00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000\nAnd then I have modified a little bit the update over here\n\n20\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000\nto maintain the differential and the integral crosstrack_error,\n\n21\n00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000\nand here is our steering control law that you are familiar with.\n\n22\n00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000\nInstead of twiddle I'm just going to give you parameters, 10, 15, and 0.\n\n23\n00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000\nThose work fine for me,\n\n24\n00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000\nand they're actually the result of running twiddle without the integral part.\n\n25\n00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000\nAnd then when I run it, I get my output. And here it is.\n\n26\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000\nThe crosstrack_error by and large is very small.\n\n27\n00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000\nYou can see the steering tends to be on the negative side.\n\n28\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000\nHere we're steering at the first turn, here we're on the straightaway.\n\n29\n00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000\nYou can see this by the numbers.\n\n30\n00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000\nHere we go into a turn again, so the turning becomes larger.\n\n31\n00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000\nIn all of this you find the crosstrack_error to be relatively small, \n\n32\n00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000\nabout 0.1 or so--not very much--and this continues and continues.\n\n33\n00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000\nThe final crosstrack_error for the second half of the race is 0.005.\n\n34\n00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000\nSo you want this number to be really, really small.\n\n35\n00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000\nThe tricky part is when you code this up and code the function cte,\n\n36\n00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000\nyou need a different branch for this area here, for this area over here,\n\n37\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000\nthis area over here, this area over here.\n\n38\n00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000\nKeep in mind that the robot is going to go in a cycle.\n\n39\n00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000\nSo it's going to traverse this one in the opposite direction with this one over here.\n\n40\n00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000\nSo good luck coding up the correct crosstrack_error function.\n\n", "id": 375001}, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GPHsFQwLEgZOdWdnZXQYwfkWDA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/358001/Nugget/376001", "type": "Nugget", "id": 376001}, {"nuggetType": "lecture", "name": "Racetrack Control Solution", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cjMLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GPHsFQw", "media": {"dotsub_id": "9b5c00f9-e18d-4505-9269-36f9b094b595", "name": "cs373_hw5_03_s_Racetrack-Control", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1chELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDA", "type": "Media", "youtube_failure_reason": null, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ch4LEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSBU1lZGlhGJGJFww", "youtube_id": "GCJXunrJjBY", "youtube_state": "done", "path": "Course/cs373/Media/378001", "transcript": "\ufeff1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000\n[Thrun] And here is my solution.

sign so instead of adding the gradient,\n\n47\n00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000\nwe're going to subtract it.\n\n48\n00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000\nLet's talk about what each of these variables mean.\n\n49\n00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000\nA is our current position.\n\n50\n00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000\nIf we were the hill climber, it would be right here where he starts off.\n\n51\n00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000\nB is going to be his next position so this is how the hill climber decides where to go next.\n\n52\n00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000\nThis gradient term tells us the direction of steepest ascent.\n\n53\n00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000\nThis - sign flips that around. It says okay, let's actually find the direction of steepest descent.\n\n54\n00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000\nThis gamma is just a waiting factor.\n\n55\n00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000\nThat's all this formula is doing.\n\n56\n00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000\nIt's saying, let's take a step down the hill and use that as our new equation--\n\n57\n00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000\nour new position. Sorry.\n\n58\n00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000\nNow to elaborate on this, we're going to need to use a little bit of calculus,\n\n59\n00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000\nso if you don't know calculus, don't be intimidated. \n\n60\n00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000\nTry your best to follow along, and if you can't, that's okay too.\n\n61\n00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000\nI think this captures the essence of what's going on with gradient descent.\n\n62\n00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000\nFirst, we have to figure out what exactly is the function we're trying to minimize.\n\n63\n00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000\nFor the purposes of the lecture, the function we're trying to minimize \n\n64\n00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:48,000\nwas a function of yi, and it was equal to some waiting alpha x xi - yi squared,\n\n65\n00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000\n+ some waiting beta x yi - yi +1 squared,\n\n66\n00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000\nso the next y coordinate,\n\n67\n00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000\nand we also do the same for the previous y coordinate,\n\n68\n00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000\nso yi - 1.\n\n69\n00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000\nWe want to minimize this, and we're going to use gradient descent.\n\n70\n00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000\nWell, gradient descent says that, we should just iterate over this process until we get\n\n71\n00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000\nto a sufficiently shallow slope that we're confident are in the bottom.\n\n72\n00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000\nWe've really found a minimum.\n\n73\n00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000\nSo at each step, we're going to follow this.\n\n74\n00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000\nB, our new location becomes yi prime.\n\n75\n00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000\nThat's going to equal our old location, yi, and then - this gradient,\n\n76\n00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000\nand the gradient here is just going to be the derivative with respect to yi.\n\n77\n00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000\nIf you don't know calculus again, don't worry about it, and if you do,\n\n78\n00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000\nthis is a fairly simple derivative.\n\n79\n00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000\nI'm going to writie it simplified. I'm not going to show you all the intermediate steps.\n\n80\n00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:59,000\nBut once we do this out, we find that yi prime = yi + 2 alpha x (xi - yi) + 2B(yi + 1 + yi  - 1 - 2yi).\n\n81\n00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000\nThis almost, almost looks like the equation that you were given in class.\n\n82\n00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000\nThere's a little problem, and that's these 2s.\n\n83\n00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000\nI'm going to do something where I just erase them.\n\n84\n00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000\nYou may be saying, hey, you're not allowed to do that,\n\n85\n00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000\nbut let's just pretend I'd originally called these parameters alpha over 2 and beta over 2,\n\n86\n00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000\nthen everything will work out just fine.\n\n87\n00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000\nThat's gradient descent.\n\n88\n00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000\nThat's where this occasion comes from in our update step.\n\n89\n00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000\nThis would be simultaneous update.\n\n90\n00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000\nAnother good way of using gradient descent.\n\n91\n00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000\nIt's not how we implement it in lectures, but that's okay.\n\n92\n00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000\nI hope this was helpful.

unchanged.\n\n3\n00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000\nI'll explain to you in a second why.\n\n4\n00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000\nThe third one went from 5 to 5.5, and the landmark went down from 7 to 6.8.\n\n5\n00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000\nGraphically, this guy becomes larger than 5, and this landmark even shifts a little bit \n\n6\n00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000\nto the left to make these two things closer together than they were before\n\n7\n00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000\nwhen they had a separation distance of 2.\n\n8\n00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000\nNow this picture doesn't really explain it well, because it's a 2D picture,\n\n9\n00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000\nbut in 1D that's exactly what's happening.\n\n10\n00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000\nAlso interesting is the initial position is unchanged.\n\n11\n00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000\nThese are the correct answers.\n\n12\n00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000\nNow, I would be blown away if you guessed them correctly.\n\n13\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000\nThe reason why the initial position doesn't change is the only information we have\n\n14\n00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000\nabout the absolute coordinate location is the very first initial position anchor \n\n15\n00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000\nthat we said was to be -3.\n\n16\n00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000\nNone of the relative rubber bands change the fact that we need this guy to be -3.\n\n17\n00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000\nA relative change between these 2 things over here \n\n18\n00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000\nmeans the rubber band is different, but it's a relative thing.\n\n19\n00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000\nThis is the only absolute constraint we put in.\n\n20\n00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000\nClearly the absolute location of the first position doesn't change.\n\n21\n00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000\nThe reason why becomes larger than 5 is--well, think about rubber bands.\n\n22\n00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000\nOur landmark is around 7. We believe to be at position 5 in the noise-free case.\n\n23\n00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000\nWe just put a tighter rubber band between them. It's not 2 anymore; it's now 1.\n\n24\n00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000\nThat means we are inclined to move the landmark and this position closer together.\n\n25\n00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000\nThat's exactly what happens.\n\n26\n00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000\nIf you go to this solution over here, the final position becomes 5.5. It's now 5.5.\n\n27\n00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000\nThe landmark becomes 6.875 instead of 7.\n\n28\n00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000\nNow, this is the case where the rubber bands don't add up.\n\n29\n00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000\nThis is one of the places where Graph Slam is just magical.\n\n30\n00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000\nBefore everything added up, but we have cycles in these structures.\n\n31\n00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000\nThese cycles might not added up, because we have noise and motion,\n\n32\n00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000\nnoise and measurements\n\n33\n00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000\nWhat our method does by computing this thing--omega to -1 times xi--\n\n34\n00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000\nwe find the best solution to the relaxation of those rubber bands.\n\n35\n00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000\nThat, to me, is sheer magic.\n\n", "id": 387004}, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNHHFwwLEgZOdWdnZXQYhbgXDA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/386001/Nugget/384005", "type": "Nugget", "id": 384005}, {"nuggetType": "lecture", "name": "Pid Solution", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cjMLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNHHFww", "media": {"dotsub_id": "9f8360b9-8572-4607-b6f6-221bfe5adca7", "name": "cs373_unit6_03_s_PID", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1chELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDA", "type": "Media", "youtube_failure_reason": "rejected: Duplicate video", "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ch4LEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSBU1lZGlhGIG1GAw", "youtube_id": "IV4wooSGQ5M", "youtube_state": "failed", "path": "Course/cs373/Media/400001", "transcript": "\ufeff1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000\nThe primary function of P is to minimize the error.

editing work so in the final code \n\n3\n00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000\nthat is a little bit incomplete still, we have a grid.\n\n4\n00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000\nWe've got a function called \"main.\"\n\n5\n00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000\nMain then runs a path planner, A-star, smooths it, and then runs the controller, as in \"run.\"\n\n6\n00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000\nThen the controller even implemented for you our particle filter that you're familiar with.\n\n7\n00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000\nThere's nothing new here.\n\n8\n00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000\nYou're going to get the exact same code from class that you programmed yourself.\n\n9\n00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000\nThen I go through a loop where I compute a crosstrack error,\n\n10\n00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000\napply my only PD controller--here is no I term here--\n\n11\n00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000\nand I run my particle filter as before to estimate where the robot is.\n\n12\n00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000\nWhat I would like you to do is to implement the crosstrack error function,\n\n13\n00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000\nand I want you to use as an input the estimate, not the actual robot position,\n\n14\n00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000\nbut the best estimate, which you can get by running filter.get_position.\n\n15\n00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000\nNow here is the difficulty, and I can tell you confidently it took me more than an hour\n\n16\n00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000\nto solve this problem myself just for this class.\n\n17\n00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000\nOur path now is a sequence of linear pieces.\n\n18\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000\nWhen our robot drives along, it has a certain crosstrack error,\n\n19\n00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000\nbut as the robot state project beyond the end of a line segment, as is happening here,\n\n20\n00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000\nwe have to change the corresponding line segments to be the next one.\n\n21\n00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000\nI addition, to calculating the assigned error relative to an arbitrary line segment,\n\n22\n00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000\nnot just the y-axis, we also have to detect when the robot steps beyond \n\n23\n00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000\nthe end of a line segment and switch over to the next one.\n\n24\n00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000\nNow, suppose this is our line segment.\n\n25\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000\nThe path is given by the coordinates of the beginning point, p1, and the end point, p2,\n\n26\n00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000\nboth of which are (x, y) coordinates, which you get straight in the path.\n\n27\n00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000\nSuppose our robot's position is something like this\n\n28\n00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000\nwhere it has its own (x, y) estimate that comes out of the particle filter in your case,\n\n29\n00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000\nand it has it's own orientation, theta.\n\n30\n00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000\nThen both the cross track error as well as how far it has progressed \n\n31\n00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000\nalong the line segment--call this \"U\"--can be calculated using a dot product.\n\n32\n00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000\nSpecifically, let's call this vector over here delta x and delta y\n\n33\n00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000\nas defined in x2 minus x1, and y2 minus y1--this vector over here.\n\n34\n00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:40,000\nLet's call this vector over here our Rx, which is x minus x1, and Ry.\n\n35\n00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000\nThen U, the ratio of how far we've progressed along this segment is given\n\n36\n00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000\nby the dot product Rx times delta x plus Ry times delta y \n\n37\n00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000\ndivided over the sum of squares delta x times delta x plus delta y times delta y. Why?\n\n38\n00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000\nWell, this normalizes the vector length to 1, and this is the dot product of this vector over here\n\n39\n00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000\nand the green vector, which happens to define the distance.\n\n40\n00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000\nIf this is larger than 1, we know we've left the segment and it's time to move onto the next one.\n\n41\n00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000\nFinally, the crosstrack error--the red one over here--is given by a similar \n\n42\n00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000\nbut not identical dot product of Ry times delta--\n\n43\n00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000\nnotice we are now multiplying a y with an x--\n\n44\n00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000\nminus--instead of plus--our x times delta y \n\n45\n00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000\nwith the exact same normalizer as down here.\n\n46\n00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000\nYou can see the normalizer over here.\n\n47\n00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000\nWhat I want you to implement are these pieces of math over here.\n\n48\n00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000\nWhen you run your controller, you will find that I setup for you a variable called \"index\"\n\n49\n00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000\nthat's the index into your path.\n\n50\n00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000\nWhen U exceeds 1, we should increment this index \n\n51\n00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000\nto make sure it never goes beyond what's legal in path length.\n\n52\n00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000\nThe crosstrack error should be computed relative to the current index\n\n53\n00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000\nand is, of course, the assigned error using the exact same dot product I've shown you.\n\n54\n00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000\nThe last thing I want to tell you is what the path is.\n\n55\n00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000\nI want you to use the following path.\n\n56\n00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000\nThe path is called \"S\" path.\n\n57\n00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000\nIt is given the run function as one of the parameters over here.\n\n58\n00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000\nYou can see it up here.\n\n59\n00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000\nS path index is the indexth element of this path and 0 stands for x and 1 stands for y.\n\n60\n00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000\nPlease fill in the missing code over here.\n\n61\n00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000\nI should tell you, when you run our controller with the missing code included, \n\n62\n00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000\nyou get actually a valid, nice path that mostly doesn't collide.\n\n63\n00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000\nOccasionally it does, because of randomness in the system,\n\n64\n00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000\nbut it should be mostly collision free.\n\n65\n00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000\nFor this example, it will require about 130 or so robot steps. \n\n66\n00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000\nJust so that you see a typical answer, here is a random run.\n\n67\n00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000\nYou read this as follows--true means the robot actually found the goal,\n\n68\n00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000\nzero means zero collisions, and it took 137 steps.\n\n69\n00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000\nLet me run it again, and here is another outcome.\n\n70\n00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000\nThe robot didn't collide and reached the goal in 145 steps.\n\n71\n00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000\nI should warn you that sometimes I do get collisions here,\n\n72\n00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000\nand it's because our obstacle surfaces are relatively large.\n\n73\n00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000\nThe noise in the system makes it hard to navigate.\n\n74\n00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000\nBut most of the time we should be able to get to the goal without difficulties\n\n75\n00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000\nif we implement this piece of code correctly.\n\n76\n00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000\nJust to warn you, it took me quite a while to work this out.\n\n", "id": 392002}, "key":

there's a constraint--\n\n4\n00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000\nInitial Position, Motion or Measurement--\n\n5\n00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000\nwe take this constraint and add something to Omega,  Xi.\n\n6\n00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000\nAnd what we add is the constraint itself,\n\n7\n00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000\nbut it's up multiplied by a strength factor.\n\n8\n00:00:20,000 -->

with this adding--\n\n11\n00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000\nwe simply calculate this guy \n\n12\n00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000\nand out comes our best possible PATH--\n\n13\n00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000\nand along with the MAP of all the landmarks. \n\n14\n00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000\nIsn't that something? Isn't that really cool?\n\n15\n00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000\nSo let's dive in and have you program your own real robot example. \n\n16\n00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000\nThis is a fairly complicated generalization of what we just saw. \n\n17\n00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000\nI'm giving you an environment where you can specify \n\n18\n00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000\nthe number of landmarks that exist,\n\n19\n00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000\nthe number of time steps you want the robot to run, \n\n20\n00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000\nthe world_size, the measurement_range--that is \n\n21\n00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000\nthe range at which a robot might be able to see a landmark--\n\n22\n00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000\nif it's further away than this--it just won't see it;\n\n23\n00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000\na motion_noise, a measurement_noise, \n\n24\n00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000\nand a distance parameter. \n\n25\n00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000\nThe distance specifies how fast a robot moves in each step. \n\n26\n00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000\nAnd then I'm giving you a routine which makes the data. \n\n27\n00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000\nIt takes all these parameters and it outputs a data field\n\n28\n00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000\nthat contains a sequence of motions and a sequence of measurements. \n\n29\n00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000\nThe code comments on the exact format of what data looks like. \n\n30\n00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000\nNow  I want you to program the function, SLAM,\n\n31\n00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000\nthat inputs the data and various important parameters\n\n32\n00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000\nand it outputs my result--a sequence of estimated poses,\n\n33\n00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000\nthe robot PATH, and estimated landmark positions. \n\n34\n00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000\nThis is really challenging to program. \n\n35\n00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000\nIt's based on the math I just gave you. \n\n36\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000\nThe robot coordinates are now x and y coordinates.\n\n37\n00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000\nThe measurements are differences in x and y--\n\n38\n00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000\nso you have to duplicate things for x and things for y. \n\n39\n00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000\nI, myself, put them all into one big matrix, \n\n40\n00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000\nbut you could have them in 2 separate matrices, if you so wish. \n\n41\n00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000\nYou have to apply everything we learned so far,\n\n42\n00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000\nincluding the weights of one with our measurerment_noise\n\n43\n00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000\nand one with our motion_noise.\n\n44\n00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000\nThese happen to be equivalent, in this case--but they might be different. \n\n45\n00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000\nAnd then you have to run SLAM \n\n46\n00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000\nand return back to me a result data structure.\n\n47\n00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000\nI'm also supplying you with the print_result routine \n\n48\n00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000\nso you can go in and see how the result has to look like. \n\n49\n00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000\nThere's an example routine--that doesn't work-- \n\n50\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000\nthat outputs all the correct formats,\n\n51\n00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000\nbut it tries not to implement the estimate that I want you to estimate. \n\n52\n00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000\nYou have to bring this to life \n\n53\n00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000\nand turn this into an amazing SLAM routine\n\n54\n00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000\nso that when you run it, you get the same results that I do\n\n55\n00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000\nfor the examples here,\n\n56\n00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000\nwhere there's an estimated PATH\n\n57\n00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000\nand estimated landmark positions. \n\n58\n00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000\nThere's one last thing I wanted to know--\n\n59\n00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000\nis I assume the initial robot position \n\n60\n00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000\nis going to be in the center of the world.\n\n61\n00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000\nSo it's the real-world set of 100\n\n62\n00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000\nand it's going to be 50/50--or here it's printed as 49.999,\n\n63\n00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000\nbut this is the same as 50.\n\n64\n00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000\nSo you have to put in a constraint \n\n65\n00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000\nthat sets the initial robot pose \n\n66\n00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000\nto the center of the world. \n\n", "id":

Car.\n\n3\n00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000\nThis is the final unit focused on putting it all together.\n\n4\n00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000\nIn this class you learned quite a bit.\n\n5\n00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000\nI didn't tell you all the secrets of the Google car, but I covered all the basic elements.\n\n6\n00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000\nYou implemented all of them in a simplified was, admittedly,\n\n7\n00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000\nbut what I focused on wasn't the nitty-gritty detail of the last little hack.\n\n8\n00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000\nWhat I focused on were the basic artificial intelligence principles.\n\n9\n00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000\nSo guess what? You just learned a lot about artificial intelligence.\n\n10\n00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000\nYou learned as much as my students at Stanford learn when they take \n\n11\n00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000\nan advanced AI class from me, and you implemented it yourself.\n\n12\n00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000\nYou can go out and implement methods like the ones I told you about by yourself.\n\n13\n00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000\nLet's review some of the things you learned.\n\n14\n00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000\nYou learned about localization, tracking, planning, and control.\n\n15\n00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000\nYou also learned about probabilities--so-called filters.\n\n16\n00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000\nYou learned about A-star, dynamic programming, DP, and about PID control.\n\n17\n00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000\nThis is a lot of stuff, and you implemented quite a bit.\n\n18\n00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000\nToday, we take all those pieces and we put them together \n\n19\n00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000\nto build a true robotic self-driving car.\n\n20\n00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000\nLet's start with localize.\n\n", "id": 387001}, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNHHFwwLEgZOdWdnZXQYodcXDA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/386001/Nugget/388001", "type": "Nugget", "id": 388001}, {"nuggetType": "lecture", "name": "Your Robot Car", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cjMLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNHHFww", "media": {"dotsub_id": "2f8fc427-b1cc-41d9-bd22-875244056da9", "name": "cs373_unit6_04_l_Your-Robot-Car", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1chELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDA", "type": "Media", "youtube_failure_reason": null, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ch4LEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSBU1lZGlhGKLXFww", "youtube_id": "aEUfsmH7j2k", "youtube_state": "processing", "path": "Course/cs373/Media/388002", "transcript": "\ufeff1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000\nNow let's put them all together into a single piece of software.\n\n2\n00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000\nUpfront it took me about a whole day to do this.\n\n3\n00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000\nI'm not going to ask you to do it all yourself, \n\n4\n00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000\nbecause it's going to cost you probably at least an hour if it takes me a day.\n\n5\n00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000\nBut I still want to be able to take all the lessons that we did together into a single system.\n\n6\n00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000\nI'm going to help you a little bit--bits and pieces--\n\n7\n00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000\nbut up front here is the environment that I wrote for you, \n\n8\n00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000\nwhich is very much derived from the environment we studied in the past.\n\n9\n00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000\nWe have a class robot that has certain kinds of noise characteristics you can find over here.\n\n10\n00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000\nAs I scroll down, you can see the familiar init function, the position-setting function,\n\n11\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000\nthe set_noise function, and then we have two checking functions--\n\n12\n00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000\nwhether we have a collision with the world called \"grid,\" which I will show you in a minute.\n\n13\n00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000\nand we have a check_goal function to see if we reached a goal \n\n14\n00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000\naccording to a certain distance threshold.\n\n15\n00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000\nThe move function should be very familiar at this point.\n\n16\n00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000\nIt applies noise to the motion command.\n\n17\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000\nIt the same code that you originally wrote.\n\n18\n00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000\nThen we have a very simple sense function, which measures the robot's (x, y) location,\n\n19\n00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000\nsimilar to a GPS on a car but with substantial measurement noise.\n\n20\n00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000\nCorresponding to this sense function we have a measurement probability function\n\n21\n00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000\nthat you might want to use in your filter, and it evaluates the probability\n\n22\n00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000\nof a measurement relative to the ground truth coordinates of the robot using Gaussians.\n\n23\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000\nArmed with all this here is the problem.\n\n24\n00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000\nI'm going to give you a grid. Here is an example grid. Let me draw this for you.\n\n25\n00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000\nThis specific one happens to be of dimensions 6 and 5,\n\n26\n00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000\nand there are a number of blocked off cells like this.\n\n27\n00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000\nIf we look carefully into the code, you'll find information about the initial starting location \n\n28\n00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000\non the left upper corner and the goal location, which is the bottom right corner.\n\n29\n00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000\nIn putting everything together, you're going to build a robotic car using our bicycle model\n\n30\n00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000\nthat'll drive through the free space through the continuous free space\n\n31\n00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000\non something close to the shortest path all the way into the goal.\n\n32\n00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000\nHere is my solution that I implemented \n\n33\n00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000\nand that you will get to see for the most part towards the end of this class.\n\n34\n00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000\nI am starting up over here. These are my obstacles. \n\n35\n00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000\nThey implement as circles through the center of these grid cells.\n\n36\n00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000\nIt's not exactly correct but good enough for my implementation.\n\n37\n00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000\nHere are multiple runs using the same code, and you can see they're far from optimal.\n\n38\n00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000\nThey are non-optimal because there is control noise, \n\n39\n00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000\nand there is also measurement noise.\n\n40\n00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000\nBut they all make it safely through free space into the corner where the goal objective is.\n\n41\n00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000\nIf we look at them in detail, like this solution over here.\n\n42\n00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000\nYou'll find that the spacing of the circles is somewhat variable.\n\n43\n00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000\nYou'll find that there's little corners over here that are either the result of control noise \n\n44\n00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000\nor of measurement noise or of my somewhat deficient implementation.\n\n45\n00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000\nYou'll also find the control set points that are the smooth points of my A-star planner\n\n46\n00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000\nas shown here in green.\n\n47\n00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000\nIn the version that I implemented for you, the controller does something very, very different.\n\n48\n00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000\nIt actually chooses as the control objective to head straight to the goal, \n\n49\n00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000\nusing the atan2 function, executes the action at a speed of 0.1,\n\n50\n00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000\nand then reports a collision whenever the robot is moving.\n\n51\n00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000\nJust looking down to the output where we see the robot's coordinates \n\n52\n00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000\nalong with the orientation there are very frequent collisions\n\n53\n00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000\n that the robot undergoes in its attempt to reach the goal,\n\n54\n00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000\nwhich it eventually does, but you can see 2 big regions of collisions\n\n55\n00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000\nuntil the goal is finally reached.\n\n", "id": 388002}, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNHHFwwLEgZOdWdnZXQYo9cXDA", "path":

"\ufeff1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000\nSo here is my solution: I've takan all the input parameters,\n\n2\n00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000\nand the very first thing is I've set the dimension of the matrix and the vector:\n\n3\n00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000\nthe length of the Path, plus the number of Landmarks--\n\n4\n00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000\ntimes 2--because I'm modeling x and y \n\n5\n00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000\nfor each of those, in the same data structures. \n\n6\n00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000\nI then create a matrix for Omega and a vector for Xi,\n\n7\n00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000\ngive it the appropriate dimensions,\n\n8\n00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000\nand subsequently I introduce the constraint \n\n9\n00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000\nthat the initial positions have to be world-size/2.0,\n\n10\n00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000\nwith a strength value of 1.0,\n\n11\n00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000\nThat tells it this has no bearing on the final solutions\n\n12\n00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000\nbecause it's the only absolute constraint.\n\n13\n00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000\nBut you can see--I add 1.0 over here in the main diagonal: \n\n14\n00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000\n1 for x and 1 for y--\n\n15\n00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000\nand then now add the same thing over here. \n\n16\n00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000\nIt's important to understand how I set up the data structure.\n\n17\n00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000\nThere's our positions--and let me just, for a second, call them \"S\".\n\n18\n00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000\nAnd there's our landmarks. \n\n19\n00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000\nEach of those have an x-component and a y-component. \n\n20\n00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000\nSo in doing this, I'm taking this matrix and I'm setting it up, \n\n21\n00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000\nnot by a matrix of Path length plus the number of landmarks, \n\n22\n00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000\nbut each of those becomes a 2 by 2 matrix, \n\n23\n00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000\nwhere I explicitly retain the x and the y value. \n\n24\n00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000\nSo the dimension here is 2 times N--the Path length--\n\n25\n00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000\nplus the number of landmarks. \n\n26\n00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000\nAnd the 2 is the result of modeling x and y:  xy, xy, xy.\n\n27\n00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000\nThat's really important for my solution. \n\n28\n00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000\nYou might have done this differently--you might have said: \n\n29\n00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000\nI'm going to build 1 matrix for x and 1 matrix for y. \n\n30\n00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000\nand then each of those becomes just a single value,\n\n31\n00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000\nwhich is closer to the way we discussed it in class. \n\n32\n00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000\nAnd that's fine, in this case. \n\n33\n00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000\nIn general, it has disadvantages\n\n34\n00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000\nin that it cannot correlate X and Ys.\n\n35\n00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000\nSo for a real robot that has real rotations, this doesn't work. \n\n36\n00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000\nMy solution is better, but for this specific example\n\n37\n00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000\nthis would have been perfectly fine. \n\n38\n00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000\nComing back to my example, I now process the data.\n\n39\n00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000\nI go through all the data items \n\n40\n00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000\nand my Path index is now the data item, times 2--\n\n41\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000\nwhich is the xy thing. \n\n42\n00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000\nI extract my measurements from the data--\n\n43\n00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000\nmy motion from the data--\n\n44\n00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000\nusing this command over here;\n\n45\n00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000\nand then I go through all the measurements, \n\n46\n00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000\nof which they are my multiple ones.\n\n47\n00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000\nI find the index in my matrix of the measurement, \n\n48\n00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000\nwhich is the Path plus the measurement index,\n\n49\n00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000\ntimes 2--because there are X and Ys again. \n\n50\n00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000\nAnd then the next routine just implements \n\n51\n00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000\nthe simple addition with the measurement_noise \n\n52\n00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000\nas the inverse weighting factor.\n\n53\n00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000\nSo it adds: 1, 1, -1, -1 \n\n54\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000\nto the corresponding elements in the submatrix,\n\n55\n00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000\nand in the vector, it adds the measurement--\n\n56\n00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000\nall divided by the strength of the noise variable. \n\n57\n00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000\nIf you look at this carefully,\n\n58\n00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000\nyou'll take a minute to digest it \n\n59\n00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000\nand what was the use in the auxilliary variable, b, \n\n60\n00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000\nto account for the effect of this x and y. \n\n61\n00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000\nSo b goes from zero to 1. \n\n62\n00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000\nAnd these are all the combinations.\n\n63\n00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000\nYou have to stare at them to make sure they are all correct,\n\n64\n00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000\nbut I can promise you--they're actually all correct. \n\n65\n00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000\nMotion is handled very much the same way:\n\n66\n00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000\nI extract the Motion command,\n\n67\n00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000\nI add among, the main diagonal--\n\n68\n00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000\nbetween the 2 variables that are being tied together--a \"+1\",\n\n69\n00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000\nand then I add, in the off-diagonal elements,\"-1\".\n\n70\n00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000\nSo again, you have to stare at this \n\n71\n00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000\nvery carefully to see they're all correct. \n\n72\n00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000\nAnd then I add the Motion itself to the vector, Xi.\n\n73\n00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000\nThat's what I had to implement.\n\n74\n00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000\nI then solve, as before, and return the solution.\n\n75\n00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000\nAnd that's exactly what's being printed out down here. \n\n76\n00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000\nI have to say, we got this correct--I'm mightily impressed.  \n\n77\n00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000\nYou understood a lot about Mapping\n\n78\n00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000\nand you solved a really hard programming problem. \n\n79\n00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000\nI'm responding to some of you online \n\n80\n00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000\nwho asked for challenging programming problems.\n\n81\n00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000\nThis is a challenging piece of code to write. \n\n82\n00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000\nIt took myself a number of hours to write,\n\n83\n00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000\nand that would be wonderful if you got it right. \n\n", "id": 387006}, "key":

00:00:40,000\nis the same as x0+10 and y1 is the same as y0.\n\n10\n00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000\nBut we learned from our various robotic Kalman filter lessons and others\n\n11\n00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000\nthat the location is actually uncertain.\n\n12\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000\nRather than assuming in our (x, y) coordinate system the robot moved to the right by 10 exactly,\n\n13\n00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000\nwe know that the actual location is a Gaussian centered around (10, 0),\n\n14\n00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000\nbut it's possible the robot is somewhere else.\n\n15\n00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000\nRemember we worked out the math for this Gaussian?\n\n16\n00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000\n Here's how it looks just for the x variable.\n\n17\n00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000\nRather than setting x1 to x0 plus 10, we try to express the Gaussian\n\n18\n00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000\n that peaks when these two things are the same.\n\n19\n00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000\nIf we subtract from x1 x0 and 10, \n\n20\n00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000\nput this into a squared format and turn this into a Gaussian,\n\n21\n00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000\nwe get a probability distribution that relates x1 and x0.\n\n22\n00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000\nWe can do the same for y.\n\n23\n00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000\nSince there is no change in y, according to our motion,\n\n24\n00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000\nall we ask is that y1 and y0 are as close together as possible.\n\n25\n00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000\nThe product of these two Gaussians is now our constraint.\n\n26\n00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000\nWe wish to maximize the likelihood of the position x1 given the position x0 is (0, 0).\n\n27\n00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:59,000\nWhat Graph SLAM does is defining our probabilities using a sequence of such constraints.\n\n28\n00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000\nSay we have a robot that moves in some space, \n\n29\n00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000\nand each location is now characterized by a vector x0 \n\n30\n00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000\nand a vector x1, vector x2, vector x3. Often they are 3-dimensional vectors.\n\n31\n00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000\nWhat Graph SLAM collects is initial location, which is a (0, 0, 0) initially--\n\n32\n00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000\nalthough here it looks a little bit different--\n\n33\n00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000\nthen, really importantly, lots of relative constraints \n\n34\n00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000\nthat relate each robot pose to the previous robot pose.\n\n35\n00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000\nWe call them relative motion constraints.\n\n36\n00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000\nYou can think of those as rubber bands.\n\n37\n00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000\nIn expectation, this rubber band will be exactly the motion the robot sensed or commanded,\n\n38\n00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000\nbut in reality, it might have to bend it a little bit to make the map more consistent.\n\n39\n00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000\nSpeaking about maps, let's use landmarks as an example.\n\n40\n00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000\nSuppose there is a landmark out here, and the landmark is being seen \n\n41\n00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000\nfrom the robot with some relative measurement--z0, z1.\n\n42\n00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000\nPerhaps I didn't see it it during time 2, but this is z3.\n\n43\n00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000\nAll these are also relative constraints\n\n44\n00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000\nvery much like the ones before.\n\n45\n00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000\nAgain, they are captured by Gaussians, and we get relative measurement contraints.\n\n46\n00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000\nOne such constraint is every time the robot sees a landmark.\n\n47\n00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000\nGraph SLAM collects thosee constraints, and as we'll see,\n\n48\n00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000\nthey're insanely easy to collect, and it just relaxes the set of rubber bands \n\n49\n00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000\nto find the most likely configuration of robot path along with the location of landmarks.\n\n50\n00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000\nThat is the mapping process.\n\n51\n00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000\nLet me ask you a quick quiz that'll take thinking.\n\n52\n00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000\nSuppose we have six robot poses--that is, one initial and five motions.\n\n53\n00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000\nWe have eight measurements of landmarks that we've seen.\n\n54\n00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000\nThese might be multiple landmarks. Sometimes the robot saw more than one.\n\n55\n00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000\nThe question now is how many total constraints do we have if we count each\n\n56\n00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000\nof these constraints as exactly one constraint.\n\n", "id": 384003}, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNHHFwwLEgZOdWdnZXQY2u4XDA", "path":

--> 00:00:08,000\nThat uncertainty might grow over time.\n\n4\n00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000\nWe need to address this; otherwise the map looks really bad.\n\n5\n00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000\nLet me

poses and all the landmarks.\n\n3\n00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000\nHere we assume the landmarks are distinguishable.\n\n4\n00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000\nEvery time we make an observation, say between two poses, \n\n5\n00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000\nthey become little additions, locally, \n\n6\n00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000\nin the 4 elements in the matrix defined over those poses.\n\n7\n00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000\nFor example, if the robot moves from x0 to x1, \n\n8\n00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000\nand we therefore believe x1 should be the same as x0, say, plus 5,\n\n9\n00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000\nthe way we enter this into the matrix is in two ways.\n\n10\n00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000\nFirst, 1 x0 and -1 x1--add it together should be -5.\n\n11\n00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000\nSo we look at the equation here--x0 minus x1 equals -5.\n\n12\n00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000\nThese are added into the matrix that starts with 0 everywhere,\n\n13\n00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000\nand it's a constraint that relates x0 and x1 by -5. It's that simple.\n\n14\n00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000\nSecondly, we do the same with x1 as positive, so we add 1 over here.\n\n15\n00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000\nFor that, x1 minus x0 equals +5, so you put 5 over here and a -1 over here.\n\n16\n00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000\nPut differently, the motion constraint that relates x0 to x1 by the motion of 5\n\n17\n00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000\nhas modified incrementally by adding values the matrix for L elements\n\n18\n00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000\n that fall between x0 and x1.\n\n19\n00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000\nWe basically wrote that constraint twice.\n\n20\n00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000\nIn both cases, we made sure the diagonal element was positive,\n\n21\n00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000\nand then we wrote the correspondant off-diagonal element as a negative value,\n\n22\n00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000\nand we added the corresponding value on the right side.\n\n23\n00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000\nLet me ask you a question.\n\n24\n00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000\nSuppose we know we go from x1 to x2 and whereas the motion over here \n\n25\n00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000\nwas +5, say, now it's -4, so we're moving back in the opposite direction.\n\n26\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000\nWhat would be the new values for the matrix over here?\n\n27\n00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000\nI'll give you a hint.\n\n28\n00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000\nThey only affect values that occur in the region between x1 and x2 and over here.\n\n29\n00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000\nRemember, these are additive.\n\n",

00:00:02,000\nThe last thing I want to tell you before we go into programming\n\n2\n00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000\n is why this makes any sense.\n\n3\n00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000\nSuppose you fill the matrix, which I call omega [\u03a9], \n\n4\n00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000\nand the vector, which I give the Greek name of xi [\u03be].\n\n5\n00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000\nMy apologies to my non-Greek students here.\n\n6\n00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000\nYou Greek students should be very proud. \n\n7\n00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000\nYou'll always have a special place in my mathematical heart.\n\n8\n00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000\nThen I can find the best solution for all the landmark positions or the world positions\n\n9\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000\nby a very simple mathematical trick that is completely counterintuitive.\n\n10\n00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000\nI invert the omega, I right multiply with xi, and out comes a vector mu [\u00b5],\n\n11\n00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000\nwhich gives me the best estimates for all the robot locations and the landmark locations.\n\n12\n00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000\nNow, that is quite amazing, because all it means in Graph SLAM is\n\n13\n00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000\n that you keep adding numbers to these matrices every time you see a constraint.\n\n14\n00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000\nWhen you're done with it, you run a very simple procedure \n\n15\n00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000\nand out comes the best places for your robot.\n\n16\n00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000\nLet's go and try it. I'm now going to ask you to program this.\n\n17\n00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000\nI'm giving you my matrix class, so you can do this easily.\n\n18\n00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000\nWhat I'm asking you to do is to build a 3 x 3 matrix and, of course, a 3 x 1 vector\n\n19\n00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000\nabout which you shall state that our initial location is -3.\n\n20\n00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000\nX1 in exportation is obtained by adding 5 to x0 and x2 is obtained by adding 3 to x1.\n\n21\n00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000\nIn exportation what we should get out when we run \n\n22\n00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000\nthe mu equals omega minus 1 times xi trick is that x0 becomes -3, \n\n23\n00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000\nx1 becomes 2, and x2 becomes 5.\n\n24\n00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000\nDiving straight into our programming environment,\n\n25\n00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000\nI'm giving you a matrix class--you might want to take a moment to look over it.\n\n26\n00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000\nIt's a little bit augmented to what I've given you before,\n\n27\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000\nand I fixed a bug with the inversion code, which is quite essential.\n\n28\n00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000\nIf I run it, I construct an omega matrix piece-by-piece--\n\n29\n00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000\nthat's the one that you should come out with--\n\n30\n00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000\na xi vector, and then I run and print out, using the \"show\" command,\n\n31\n00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000\nthe result of omega to the -1 times c.\n\n32\n00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000\nYou can see -3, 2, and 5 are the correct results \n\n33\n00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000\nthat result from the omega matrix and the xi vector.\n\n34\n00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000\nWhat I want you to do is write code that incrementally step-by-step constructs \n\n35\n00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000\nthe omega vector and the xi function and then returns to me those results over here.\n\n36\n00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000\nThere is an empty function in your code that accepts as parameter\n\n37\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000\n the initial position, -3, and the two motion values, 5 and 3.\n\n", "id": 414002}, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNHHFwwLEgZOdWdnZXQYsqUYDA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/386001/Nugget/398002", "type": "Nugget", "id": 398002}, {"nuggetType": "lecture", "name": "Slam", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cjMLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNHHFww", "media": {"dotsub_id": "c003a25a-e0d6-4271-a497-e03656895a2e", "name": "cs373_unit6_08_l_SLAM", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1chELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDA", "type": "Media", "youtube_failure_reason": null, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ch4LEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSBU1lZGlhGNnrGAw", "youtube_id": "O5Zu19-tjY8", "youtube_state": "done", "path": "Course/cs373/Media/407001", "transcript": "\ufeff1\n00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000\nHi, students.

apart\n\n3\n00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000\nwith some Gaussian noise, and we know the Gaussian noise in exportation\n\n4\n00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000\nmoves the right robot position 10 off the left robot position, but there is some uncertainty.\n\n5\n00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000\nWhen we talked about Kalman filters, we talked about Gaussians,\n\n6\n00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000\nand this uncertainty might look at follows:\n\n7\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000\nThere is a constant exponential, and the expression that x1 minus x0\n\n8\n00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000\nshould relax to 10 but might deviate from it.\n\n9\n00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000\nThis Gaussian constraint over here characterizes the constraint between x1 and x0\n\n10\n00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000\nand wishes them to be exactly 10 apart.\n\n11\n00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000\nThe Gaussian is maximum where this equation is fulfilled, \n\n12\n00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000\nbut if the residual is not equal to 0, there is still a probability associated with it.\n\n13\n00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000\nLet's now model a second motion.                  Say x2 is 5 apart.\n\n14\n00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000\nWe now get an even bigger Gaussian relative to the very first one,\n\n15\n00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000\nbut the local constraint over here reads just like the constraint over there.\n\n16\n00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000\nLet me just write it down.\n\n17\n00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000\nX2 minus x1 minus 5 squared over sigma-squared.\n\n18\n00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000\nNow, the total probability of this entire thing over here is the product of these two things.\n\n19\n00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000\nIf we want to maximize the product, we can play a number of interesting tricks.\n\n20\n00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000\nFirst, the constant has no bearing on the maximum, just on the absolute value.\n\n21\n00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000\nIf we want to find the best values for x0 and x1 and so on, we can drop the constant.\n\n22\n00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000\nSecondly, we can drop the exponential \n\n23\n00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000\nif we're willing to turn the product into an addition.\n\n24\n00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000\nRemember, we added things in omega and in sigma. That's why.\n\n25\n00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000\nFinally, we can actually drop the -1/2. \n\n26\n00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000\nIt turns out that also plays no role in the maximization of this expression.\n\n27\n00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000\nIt turns out what you added where constraints just like these, \n\n28\n00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000\nand you even added them at a certain strength of 1 over sigma-squared.\n\n29\n00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000\nIn particular, if you really believe that a constraint is true,\n\n30\n00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000\nyou should add a larger value in this matrix over here,\n\n31\n00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000\nand on the right side you should multiply the right constraint with an even larger value.\n\n32\n00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000\nPut differently, take an expression like this and multiply in the sigma-squared\n\n33\n00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000\nyou get something of this nature over here where 1 over sigma  \n\n34\n00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000\nregulates how confident you are.\n\n35\n00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000\nFor a small sigma, 1 over sigma becomes large.\n\n36\n00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000\nSo 5 is much larger than 1.\n\n37\n00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000\nThat means you have much more confidence.\n\n38\n00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000\nLet's go back to the code and modify the code \n\n39\n00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000\nso the last measurement has a really high confidence.\n\n40\n00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000\nI want you to multiply the last measurement between x2 and our landmark\n\n41\n00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000\nwith a factor of 5 in your code. Hard code it. \n\n42\n00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000\nThat is, go in somewhere over here where the last measurement is being applied\n\n43\n00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000\nand do the trick that I just showed you and see what the outcome is.\n\n44\n00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000\nWhen I do this, I get -3, 2.1, 5.714, and 6.821 as the answers.\n\n45\n00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000\nYou'll see in this final result\n\n46\n00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000\n the final robot position of 5.714 and the landmark position of 8.821\n\n47\n00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000\nare really close to 1 in difference, which was the measurement,\n\n48\n00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000\nbecause you know believe this measurement \n\n49\n00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000\nover-proportionally over other measurements and motions.\n\n", "id": 405007}, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNHHFwwLEgZOdWdnZXQY8uMYDA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/386001/Nugget/406002", "type": "Nugget", "id": 406002}, {"nuggetType": "lecture", "name": "Congratulations", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cjMLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNHHFww", "media": {"dotsub_id": null, "name": "cs373_unit6_22_p_Congratulations", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1chELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDA", "type": "Media", "youtube_failure_reason": null, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ch4LEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSBU1lZGlhGOOVGAw", "youtube_id": "os1I4ikNQC4", "youtube_state": "done", "path": "Course/cs373/Media/396003", "transcript": null, "id": 396003}, "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNHHFwwLEgZOdWdnZXQY2usYDA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/386001/Nugget/407002", "type": "Nugget", "id": 407002}, {"nuggetType": "quiz", "name": "Graph Slam", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cjMLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNHHFww", "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNHHFwwLEgZOdWdnZXQYwvMYDA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/386001/Nugget/408002", "type": "Nugget", "id": 408002}, {"nuggetType": "program", "name": "Omega And Xi", "parent": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cjMLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNHHFww", "key": "agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckELEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMzczDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNHHFwwLEgZOdWdnZXQYw_MYDA", "path": "Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012/Unit/386001/Nugget/408003", "suppliedCode": "# -----------\n# User Instructions\n#\n# Write a function, doit, that takes as its input an\n# initial robot position, move1, and move2.

------------\n# User Instructions\n#\n# In this problem you will implement a more manageable\n# version of graph SLAM in 2 dimensions. \n#\n# Define a function, online_slam, that takes 5 inputs:\n# data, N, num_landmarks, motion_noise, and\n# measurement_noise--just as was done in the last \n# programming assignment of unit 6. This function\n# must return TWO matrices, mu and the final Omega.\n#\n# Just as with the quiz, your matrices should have x\n# and y interlaced, so if there were two poses and 2\n# landmarks, mu would look like:\n#\n# mu = matrix([[Px0],\n#              [Py0],\n#              [Px1],\n#              [Py1],\n#              [Lx0],\n#              [Ly0],\n#              [Lx1],\n#              [Ly1]])\n#\n# Enter your code at line 566.\n\n# -----------\n# Testing\n#\n# You have two methods for testing your code.\n#\n# 1) You can make your own data with the make_data\n#    function. Then you can run it through the\n#    provided slam routine and check to see that your\n#    online_slam function gives the same estimated\n#    final robot pose and landmark positions.\n# 2) You can use the solution_check function at the\n#    bottom of this document to check your code\n#    for the two provided test cases. The grading\n#    will be almost identical to this function, so\n#    if you pass both test cases, you should be\n#    marked correct on the homework.\n\nfrom math import *\nimport random\n\n\n# ------------------------------------------------\n# \n# this is the matrix class\n# we use it because it makes it easier to collect constraints in GraphSLAM\n# and to calculate solutions (albeit inefficiently)\n# \n\nclass matrix:\n    \n    # implements basic operations of a matrix class\n\n    # ------------\n    #\n    # initialization - can be called with an initial matrix\n    #\n\n    def __init__(self, value = [[]]):\n        self.value = value\n        self.dimx  = len(value)\n        self.dimy  = len(value[0])\n        if value == [[]]:\n            self.dimx = 0\n            \n    # -----------\n    #\n    # defines matrix equality - returns true if corresponding elements\n    #   in two matrices are within epsilon of each other.\n    #\n    \n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        epsilon = 0.01\n        if self.dimx != other.dimx or self.dimy != other.dimy:\n            return False\n        for i in range(self.dimx):\n            for j in range(self.dimy):\n                if abs(self.value[i][j] - other.value[i][j]) > epsilon:\n                    return False\n        return True\n    \n    def __ne__(self, other):\n        return not (self == other)\n\n    # ------------\n    #\n    # makes matrix of a certain size and sets each element to zero\n    #\n\n    def zero(self, dimx, dimy):\n        if dimy == 0:\n            dimy = dimx\n        # check if valid dimensions\n        if dimx < 1 or dimy < 1:\n            raise ValueError, \"Invalid size of matrix\"\n        else:\n            self.dimx  = dimx\n            self.dimy  = dimy\n            self.value = [[0.0 for row in range(dimy)] for col in range(dimx)]\n\n    # ------------\n    #\n    # makes matrix of a certain (square) size and turns matrix into identity matrix\n    #\n\n    def identity(self, dim):\n        # check if valid dimension\n        if dim < 1:\n            raise ValueError, \"Invalid size of matrix\"\n        else:\n            self.dimx  = dim\n            self.dimy  = dim\n            self.value = [[0.0 for row in range(dim)] for col in range(dim)]\n            for i in range(dim):\n                self.value[i][i] = 1.0\n                \n    # ------------\n    #\n    # prints out values of matrix\n    #\n\n    def show(self, txt = ''):\n        for i in range(len(self.value)):\n            print txt + '['+ ', '.join('%.3f'%x for x in self.value[i]) + ']' \n        print ' '\n\n    # ------------\n    #\n    # defines elmement-wise matrix addition.
