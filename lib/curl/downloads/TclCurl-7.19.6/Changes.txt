Version 7.19.6 released 30-Sep-2009

	* New configure options:
	
		* certinfo: Pass a 1 to enable TclCurl's certificate chain info
		  gatherer. With this enabled, TclCurl (if libcurl is built with OpenSSL
		  support) will extract lots of information and data about the
		  certificates in the certificate chain used in the SSL connection.
		  
		  It is then possible to extract this data after the transfer using
		  '$curlHandle getinfo certinfo'.

        * noproxy: Pass a string, a comma-separated list of hosts which do not use
          a proxy, if one is specified. The only wildcard is a single * character,
          which matches all hosts and effectively disables the proxy. Each name in
          this list is matched as either a domain which contains the hostname, or
          the hostname itself. For example, local.com would match local.com,
          local.com:80, and www.local.com, but not www.notlocal.com.  
          
		* postredir: Controls how TclCurl acts on redirects after POSTs that get
		  a 301 or 302 response back.
		  
		  A "301" as parameter tells the TclCurl to respect RFC 2616/10.3.2 and not
		  convert POST requests into GET requests when following a 301 redirection.
		  
		  Passing a "302" makes TclCurl maintain the request method after a 302
		  redirect. 
		  
		  "all" is a convenience string that activates both behaviours.

          The non-RFC behaviour is ubiquitous in web browsers, so the extension does the
	      conversion by default to maintain consistency. However, a server may require a
	      POST to remain a POST after such a redirection.

          This option is meaningful only when setting '-followlocation'.

          The option used to be known as '-post301', which should still work but is
		  now deprecated.

        * protocols: Pass a list, in lowercase, with the protocols TclCurl is allowed
          to use. This allows you to have a libcurl built to support a wide range of
          protocols but still limit specific transfers to only be allowed to use a
          subset of them.
          
          By default TclCurl will accept all protocols supported by libcurl.

          Supported protocols are: http, https, ftp, ftps, scp, sftp, telnet, ldap,
          ldaps, dict. file and tftp. You can use the string 'all' to enable all of
          them
        
        * redirprotocols: Pass a list, in lowercase, with the protocols that TclCurl
          may use in a transfer that it follows to in a redirect when 'followlocation'
          is enabled. This allows you to limit specific transfers to a subset of
          protocols in redirections. By default TclCurl will allow all protocols except
          for FILE and SCP.
          
		* socks5gssapiservice: Pass a string holding the name of the service.
		
		  The default service name for a SOCKS5 server is rcmd/server-fqdn. This
		  option allows you to change it.
		  
		* socks5gssapinec: Pass a l1 to enable or 0 to disable. As part of the
		  gssapi negotiation a protection mode is negotiated, the rfc1961 says in
		  section 4.3/4.4 it should be protected, but the NEC reference
		  implementation does not. If enabled, this option allows the unprotected
		  exchange of the protection mode negotiation.

        * sshknownhosts: Pass a string holding the file name of the known_host file to
          use. The known_hosts file should use the OpenSSH file format as supported by
          libssh2. If this file is specified, TclCurl will only accept connections with
          hosts that are known and present in that file, with a matching public key.
          
        * sshkeyproc: Pass the name of the procedure that will be called when the
          known_host matching has been done to allow the application to act and decide
          for TclCurl how to proceed. It gets passed a list with three elements, the
          first one is a list with the type of the key from the known_hosts file and
          the key itself, the second is another list with the type of the key from the
          remote site and the key itslef, the third tells you what TclCurl thinks about
          the matching status. 

          The known key types are: "rsa", "rsa1" and "dss", in any other case "unknown"
          is given.

          TclCurl opinion about how they match may be: "match", "mismatch", "missing" or
          "error".

          The procedure must return:
          
            - 0: The host+key is accepted and TclCurl will append it to the known_hosts
                 file before continuing with the connection. This will also add the
                 host+key combo to the known_host pool kept in memory if it wasn't
                 already present there. Note that the adding of data to the file is done
                 by completely replacing the file with a new copy, so the permissions of
                 the file must allow this.
                 
            - 1: The host+key is accepted, TclCurl will continue with the connection.
                 This will also add the host+key combo to the known_host pool kept in
                 memory if it wasn't already present
                 
            - 2: The host+key is rejected. TclCurl will close the connection.
            
            - 3: The host+key is rejected, but the SSH connection is asked to be kept
                 alive. This feature could be used when the app wants to somehow return
                 back and act on the host+key situation and then retry without needing
                 the overhead of setting it up from scratch again.

            - Any other value will cause the connection to be closed.
            
		* tftpblksize: Specify block size to use for a TFTP data transmission. Valid
		  range as per RFC 2348 is 8-65464 bytes. The default of 512 bytes will be
		  used if this option is not specified. The specified block size will only
		  be used pending support by the remote server. If the server does not
		  return an option acknowledgement or returns an option acknowledgement with
		  no blksize, the default of 512 bytes will be used.
		  
		* httpauth gets a new authentication methotd 'digestie', HTTP Digest
		  authentication with an IE flavor. Digest authentication is defined in RFC2617
		  and is a more secure way to do authentication over public networks than the
		  regular old-fashioned Basic method. With the IE flavor TclCurl will use a
		  special "quirk" that IE is known to have used before version 7 and that some
		  servers require the client to use.
          
        * proxytype may now be set to "http1.0".
		  
	* New info available through the 'getinfo' command:
	
		* certinfo: The command will return a lists, the first item is the
		  number of certs, and then the info about those certs. The info chain
		  is provided in a series of data in the format "name:content" where the
		  content is for the specific named data.

		  NOTE: this option is only available in libcurl built with OpenSSL support.

	* Internal changes:
	
		* Update the configure/makefile scripts to TEA 3.7, please report
		  any problems.
		  
	* Bug fixes:
	
		* I completely messed the option "ftpsslccc", to the point where
		  all the configure options added after it wouldn't work.
		  
Version 7.19.0 released 1-Sep-2008

    * New commands:

        * curlHandle pause and curlHandle resume: Pause and resume a
          tranfer from within a progress callback procedure.

    * New configure options:

        * addressscope: Pass a number specifying the scope_id value to
          use when connecting to IPv6 link-local or site-local addresses.

        * proxytranfermode: Pass a number. If the value is set to 1 (one),
          it tells TclCurl to set the transfer mode (binary or ASCII) for
          FTP transfers done via an HTTP proxy, by appending ;type=a or
          ;type=i to the URL. Without this setting, or if set to 0 (zero,
          the default), '-tranfertext' has no effect when doing FTP via a
          proxy. Beware that not all proxies support this feature.

        * Added two new types for the '-proxytype' option: 'socks4a'
          and 'socks5hostname'.

    * New info available through the 'getinfo' command:

        * appconnecttime: Returns the time, in seconds, it took from the start
          until the SSL/SSH connect/handshake to the remote host was completed.

        * primaryip: Returns the IP address of the most recent connection done
          with this handle.

        * redirecturl: Returns the URL a redirect would take you to if you would
          enable 'followlocation'. This can come very handy if you think using
          the built-in redirect logic isn't good enough for you but you would
          still prefer to avoid implementing all the magic of figuring out the
          new URL.

    * Bug fix: The 'writeproc' option didn't work right.


    * Internal changes:

        * When compìling against Tcl 8.5.3 I had to remove a lot of CONSTs to
          prevent warnings, and then I had to add them back with Tcl 8.5.4,
          so, depending on which version you use you might get quite a few
          warnings while compiling, they should be harmless though.

        * The internal workings of the 'any' http authentication has been changed.

2008-08-25 Andres Garcia <fandom@telefonica.net>

    * generic/tclcurl.h,
      generic/tclcurl.c: Changed the 'anyauth rewind' to use the new
      CURLOPT_SEEKFUNCTION and CURLOPT_SEEKDATA.

Version 7.17.1 released 1-Nov-2007

    * New configure options:

        * post301: A non-zero parameter tells TclCurl to respect
          RFC 2616/10.3.2 and not convert POST requests into GET
          requests when following a 301 redirection like browsers
          usually do.

        * sshhostpublickeymd5: Pass a string containing 32 hexadecimal
          digits. The string should be the 128 bit MD5 cheksum of the
          remote host public key, and TclCurl will reject the connection
          to the host unless the md5sums match.

        * If you pass the magic string 'FLUSH' to the '-cookielist'
          option all known cookies will be written to the file
          specified by '-cookiejar'.

    * Renamed options:

        Some configure options have been renamed so they get more general
        names, the old names are deprecated even if they may be supported
        forever.

            * sslpasswd   => keypasswd
            * ftpappend   => append
            * ftplistonly => dirlistonly
            * ftpssl      => usessl

    * Internal changes:

        Up until the current version when we wanted libcurl to use a value
        in a string, like the URL to download, we had to keep the string as
        long as libcurl could use it. Since 7.17.0 libcurl keeps it own
        copies, so I no longer make TclCurl do it.

        That means this is a handle-with-care release, please report any
        problems you may have.


Version 7.16.4 released 19-July-07

    * New configure options:

        * newfileperms: Used to set the permissions, defalt 0664, that will be
          assigned to newly created files on the remote server.

        * newdirectoryperms: Used to set the permissions, default 0755, that
          will be assigned to newly created directories on the remote server.

          They can both be used for SFTP, SCP and FILE transfers.

    * Changed option: The option to set the Kerberos security
      level for FTP is now called 'krblevel', the old name
      'krb4level' will be kept for some time for compatibility.

    * New option for multi handles:

        * maxconnects: Sets the maximum amount of simultaneously open
          connections that TclCurl may cache. Default is 10.

    * Bug fix: Sven Hoexter fixed a couple of errors in the man page.

Version 7.16.2 released 16-April-07

    * New feature: TclCurl now supports SSH for SFTP and SCP transfers as long
      as libcurl has been compiled with libssh2 support.

    * New configure options:

        * publickeyfile: name of the file with the public key to use with SSH.

        * privatekeyfile: name of the file with the provate key to use with SSH.

        * sshauthtypes: Allowed types are "publickey", "password", "host",
          "keyboard", or "any" to let TclCurl choose one.

        * timeoutms and connectimeoutms: The work like 'timeout' and
          'connectimeout' except the timout is given in miliseconds.

        * ftpsslccc: If enabled, it will make libcurl shutdown SSL/TLS after
          the authentication is done on a FTP-SSL operation.

        * httpcontentdecoding: If set to zero content decoding is disabled.

        * httptransferdecoding: If set to zero Set transfer decoding is
          disabled. TclCurl does chunked transfer decoding by default
          unless this option is set to zero.

        * ftpsslccc: If enabled, it will make libcurl shutdown SSL/TLS after
          the authentication is done on a FTP-SSL operation.

    * Bug fixes:

        * Olivier Lenormand reported that in case the server sends more than
          one 'Set-Cookie' header, TclCurl would only save the last one in
          the header array. Now the array will contain a list with all the
          cookies.

        * Jos Decoster reported and helped fixing a crash that happened when
          changing a handle from using a 'writeproc' to not using one.

    * I have updated the configure scripts to TEA 3.6, hope you don't bump into
      any regressions.

Version 7.16.0 released 15-November-06

    * Removed feature: TclCurl no longer supports third party FTP transfers.

    * New configure options:

        * ftpalternativetouser: Pass a string which will be used to authenticate
          if the usual FTP "USER user" and "PASS password" negotiation fails. This
          is currently only known to be required when connecting to Tumbleweed's
          Secure Transport FTPS server using client certificates for
          authentication.

        * ftpentrypath: Returns a string holding the path of the entry path.
          That is the initial path TclCurl ended up in when logging on to the
          remote FTP server. Returns an empty string if something is wrong.

        * maxsendspeed: Pass a speed in bytes per seconds. If an upload exceeds this
          speed on cumulative average during the transfer, the transfer will pause to
          keep the average rate less than or equal to the parameter value.

        * maxrecvspeed: Pass a speed in bytes per second. If a download exceeds this
          speed on cumulative average during the transfer, the transfer will pause to
          keep the average rate less than or equal to the parameter value.

    * New command for multi handles 'configure', so far the is only one option to set:

        * pipelining: Pass a 1 to enable or 0 to disable. Enabling pipelining on a multi
          handle will make it attempt to perform HTTP Pipelining as far as possible for
          transfers using this handle. This means that if you add a second request that
          can use an already existing connection, the second request will be "piped" on
          the same connection rather than being executed in parallel.

Version 0.15.3 released 17-April-06

    * I updated the autoconf scripts to TEA 3.5, this seems to prevent
      the warnings about how the headers files couldn't be compiled,
      but it may have (re)introduced other bugs.

    * Removed feature: TclCurl no longer supports Gopher, it probably
      didn't work anyway.

    * New configure options:

        * localport: Sets the local port number of the socket used for
          the connection. This can be used in combination with '-interface'
          and you are recommended to use 'localportrange' as well when this
          is set.

        * localportrange: Number of attempts TclCurl should do to find a
          working local port number. It starts with the given 'localport'
          and adds one to the number for each retry.

Version 0.15.1 released 10-January-06

    * New configure options:

        * ftpskippasvip: If set to a non-zero value, it instructs TclCurl
          not to use the IP address the server suggests in its 227-response
          to TclCurl's PASV command when TclCurl connects the data connection.
          Instead TclCurl will re-use the same IP address it already uses for
          the control connection. But it will use the port number from the
          227-response.

        * ftpfilemethod: It allows three values:

              * multicwd: the default, TclCurl will do a single CWD operation
                for each path part in the given URL. For deep hierarchies this
                means very many commands. This is how RFC1738 says it should
                be done.

              * nocwd: no CWD at all is done, TclCurl will do SIZE, RETR, STOR
                etc and give a full path to the server.

              * singlecwd: make one CWD with the full target directory and then
                operate on the file "normally".

          The support for this options is still experimental, comments whether
          the methods work or don't with different methods are welcome.

          Likewise, the options, or their names, may change in future releases,
          so they are not yet documented elsewhere.

     * Bug fix: The Windows packages had defective 'doc' directories. Thanks to
       Alex Hisen for letting me know.

Version 0.14.1 released 4-September-05

    * New configure options:

        * ingnorecontentlength: Ignore the Content-Length header. This is
          useful for Apache 1.x (and similar servers) which will report
          incorrect content length for files over 2 gigabytes.

        * cookielist: Pass a string with a cookie. The cookie can be
          either in Netscape / Mozilla format or just regular HTTP-style
          header (Set-Cookie: ...) format.

          '$curlHandle getinfo cookielist' will return a list of all
          cookies TclCurl knows (expired ones, too).

        * When posting data, you can use the new 'filecontent' option to
          read a file and use its contents as data.

    * Bug fix: The code to post data was filled with memory leaks, I hope
      I have fixed them all.

Version 0.14.0 released 3-June-05

    * BEHAVIOUR CHANGE: To set the version SSL/TLS to use with
      '-sslversion' you can know use the values:

        * default
            The default action. When libcurl built with OpenSSL, this will
            attempt to figure out the remote SSL protocol version.
            Unfortunately there are a lot of ancient and broken servers in
            use which cannot handle this technique and will fail to
            connect. When libcurl is built with GnuTLS, this will mean SSLv3.

        * tlsv1
            Force TLSv1

        * sslv2
            Force SSLv2

        * sslv3
            Force SSLv3

    * Bug fix: A report by Melissa Millard made me realize that the
      options 'httpauth', 'proxyauth', 'ipresolve', 'ftpssl' and
      'ftpsslauth' have, probably, never worked. They should now.

    * I updated 'configure.in' and 'Makefile.in' to the latest versions
      in Tcl's sample extension, unfortunately that's likely to introduce
      some bugs, so, please, report any problems.

Version 0.13.2 released 16-April-05

    * New features:

        * New configure options:

             * ftpaccount: When an FTP server asks for "account data"
               after user name and password has been provided.

             * sourceurl: When set, it enables a FTP third party transfer.

             * sourcequote: Exactly like '-quote', but for the source host.

        * The following options are now obsolete 'sourcehost', 'sourcepath',
          'sourceport' and 'pasvhost'.

        * curl::versioninfo will indicate if there is support for
          SSPI.

        * More information can be obtained using 'curl::getinfo':

              * numconnects: to get the number of new connections
                TclCurl had to create to achieve the previous transfer.

              * sslengines: returns a list of the OpenSSL crypto-engines
                supported.

              * httpconnectcode: returns the last received proxy
                response code to a CONNECT request

    * Bug fix:

        * Fixed the "-sourcepostquote" option.

        * Daniel A. Steffen fixed a bug with parallel builds.

Version 0.12.2 released 18-October-04

    * New features:

        * You can now share dns and cookie information among TclCurl
          handles, please check the docs for details.

        * New configure option: 'ftpsslauth', you may need this option
          because of servers like BSDFTPD-SSL from won't work properly
          when "AUTH SSL" is issued but require "AUTH TLS" instead.

        * Added three new commands to the 'curl' namespace:

            * curl::easystrerror   errorCode

            * curl::sharestrerror  errorCode

            * curl::multistrerror  errorCode

          All three will return a string explaining what the given error
          number means.

    * Bug fix:

        * Ralph Mitchell reported that the 'cookiejar' option wouldn't
          work in the latest version, it should now.

Version 0.12.1 released 30-September-04

    * New features:

        * Third party ftp support, you can now transfer a file between
          two different ftp servers. Check the 'ftp options' in the docs
          page for details.

        * A new command for curl handles 'reset' which re-initializes all
          options previously set on a specified handle to the default values.

          This puts back the handle to the same state as it was in when it
          was just created with curl::init.

          It does not change the following information kept in the handle:
          live connections, the Session ID cache, the DNS cache, the cookies
          and shares.

        * Hooked the multi interface to Tcl's event loop, so you can have
          fire-and-forget transfers:

                set multiHandle [curl::multiinit]
                set easyHandle  [curl::init]

                $easyHandle  configure -file home.tar.gz                  \

                $multiHandle addhandle $easyHandle
                $multiHandle auto -command "CleanUp $multiHandle $easyHandle"

          This support is experimental, so any comments are welcome.

          Thanks to Eric Boudaillier who answered my question about how to
          do it.

        * New ssl data types have been added to 'debugproc'.

        * In case of error when setting post data, the error will include a
          code about the nature of the error.

    * Bug fix:

        * The 'autoreferer' option should now work.

Version 0.12.0 released 09-July-04

    * New configure options:

        * '-port': Pass the number specifying what remote port to connect to,
          instead of the one specified in the URL or the default port for the
          used protocol.

        * '-tcpnodelay': To specify whether the TCP_NODELAY option should be
           set or cleared.

           Setting this option will disable TCP's Nagle algorithm. The purpose
           of this algorithm is to try to minimize the number of small packets
           on the network.

        * '-autoreferer': When enabled, TclCurl will automatically set the
          'Referer:' field in requests where it follows a 'Location:' redirect.

    * Bug fix:

        * Thanks to Stefano Federici I noticed that the 'ftpssl' option didn't
          work.

Version 0.11.0 released 04-febrary-04


    * New configure options:

        * 'ftpssl': You can use ftps:// URLs to explicitly switch on SSL/TSL
          for the control connection and the data connection.

          Alternatively you can set this option to one of these values:

              * 'nope': Do not attempt to use SSL

              * 'try': Try using SSL, proceed anyway otherwise.

              * 'control': Use SSL for the control conecction or fail.

              * 'all': Use SSL for all communication or fail.

        * 'netrcfile': Pass a string containing the full path name to the
          file you want to use as .netrc file. For the option to work, you
          have to set the 'netrc' option to 'required'. If this option is
          omitted, and 'netrc' is set, TclCurl will attempt to find the a
          .netrc file in the current user's home directory.

    * Bug fix: Fixed the 'netrc' option.

Version 0.10.8 released 29-december-03

    * New 'configure' options:

      * 'ftpresponsetimeout': Causes TclCurl to set a timeout period
        on the amount of time that the server is allowed to take in
        order to generate a response message for a command before the
        session is considered hung.

      * 'ipresolve': Allows an application to select what kind of
        IP addresses to use when resolving host names. This is only
        interesting when using host names that resolve addresses
        using more than one version of IP.

      * 'maxfilesize': Allows you to specify the maximum size
        of a file to download.

    * New 'getinfo' options:

      * 'httpauthavail': Returns a list with the authentication method(s)
        available.

      * 'proxyauthavail': Returns a list with the authentication method(s)
        available for your proxy athentication.

    * Misc:

      * 'curl::versioninfo' will now say if there is support for
        asynchronus DNS and SPNEGO.

      * The 'httpcode' for 'getinfo' is now called 'responsecode'
        since it will now work with FTP transfers. The old option
        name, while deprecated, will continue to work.

    * Bug fixes:

      * TclCurl still thought it was in version 0.10.4.

      * Fixed the 'httpauth' option.

      * The configure scripts would sometimes use the cURL in
        '/usr/bin' instead of the one in '/usr/local/bin' despite
        the '--with-curlprefix' tag.

Version 0.10.7 released 03-September-03

  * New configure options:

    * 'ftpcreatemissingdirs': If set to non-zero, TclCurl
      will attempt to create any remote directory that it
      fails to CWD into. CWD is the command that changes
      working directory.

    * 'httpauth': Set to the authentication method you want,
      the available ones are:

        * 'basic': HTTP Basic authentication. This is the
          default choice, and the only method that is in
          widespread use and supported virtually everywhere.
          It sends the user name and password over the network
          in plain text, easily captured by others.

        * 'digest': HTTP Digest authentication. Digest
           authentication is a more secure way to do
           authentication over public networks than the
           regular old-fashioned Basic method.

        * 'gssnegotiate': HTTP GSS-Negotiate authentication.
           The GSS-Negotiate method was designed by Microsoft
           and is used in their web aplications. It is primarily
           meant as a support for Kerberos5 authentication
           but may be also used along with another authenti-
           cation methods.

        * 'ntlm': HTTP NTLM authentication. A proprietary
          protocol invented and used by Microsoft.

        * 'any':TclCurl will automaticaly select the one it
          finds most secure.

        * 'anysafe': It may use anything but basic, TclCurl
          will automaticly select the one it finds most secure.


    * 'command': Executes a Tcl command after the transfer
      is done. So far it only works in blocking transfers
      which is pretty much useless.

Version 0.10.5 released 21-May-03

  * New configure option:

    * 'ftpuseeptr': Set to non-zero, to tell TclCurl to use the EPRT
      (and LPRT) command when doing active FTP downloads (which is
      enabled by 'ftpport'). Using EPRT means that it will first attempt
      to use EPRT and then LPRT before using PORT, if you pass zero to
      this option, it will not try using EPRT or LPRT, only plain PORT

  * Bug fixes:

    * The multi handles couldn't store the data of more than two
     easy handles.

    * Using the 'progressproc' option in Windows would crash Tcl.

    * The '$multiHandle active' command wasn't returning anything.

  * Misc:

    * Updated ssl in Windows binaries to version 0.9.7b.

    * Changed the way the http reponse header is dealt with in
     the 'headervar' option. Now the whole header is put into
     foo(http).

     ************** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY **************

Version 0.10.4 released 31-March-03

  * New features:

    * Added 'getinfo' features to the 'curl::transfer' command.

     You can now do things like:

       curl::transfer -url http://www.curl.com   \
           -infohttpcode   httpCode              \
           -infocontenttype contentType          \

       puts "Http code: $httpCode"
       puts "Content type: $contentType"

    * New configure option: -unrestrictedauth, a non-zero parameter
      tells the extension it can continue to send authentication
      (user+password) when following locations, even when hostname
      changed. Note that this is meaningful only when setting
      -followlocation

    * The makefile now has an 'uninstall' target.

    * The Windows packages are now zlib enabled.

    * Added a 'packages' directory with a makefile to create the
      Windows packages and the spec file for rpm.

  * Bug fix:

    * The configure script will no longer choke with the version
      string of cURL's prereleases.

  * Misc

    * If there is an error, the 'curl::transfer' command will now
      return the code of the error, without the 'Couldn't perform
      transfer' message.

     ************** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY **************

    * So that they have the same name in Windows and Linux, I have
      changed the name of the certificate file in Windows to
      'curl-ca-bundle.crt' and it will placed in the 'Windows'
      directory.

     ************** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY **************

    * Alex Khassin suggested using fully qualified in 'tclcurl.tcl'
      names to prevent problems with namespaces.

Version 0.10.3 released 30-January-03

  * New configure option:

    * 'http200alieases': To pass a list of aliases to be treated as valid
       HTTP 200 responses.

  * Bug fixes:

    * When using '-headervar' in Windows you could end up with carriage
      returns in the name of the header.

    * Julian let me know that TclCurl would crash when used in a thread
      enabled Tcl.

  * Enhancements:

    * Since compiling TclCurl in Windows is a real pain, I will provide
      more packages for it, thread and ssl enabled.

    * Alex Khassin has written instructions on how to get TclCurl to work
      with AOLSever.

Version 0.10.1 released 14-October-02

  * New configure options:

    * 'proxytype': Allows you to set type of the proxy. Available options
      are 'http' and 'socks5', with the HTTP one being default.

    * 'encoding': TclCurl can now request compressed contents using the
      'deflate' method.

    * 'buffersize': To set prefered size for the receive buffer in TclCurl,
      so that the write callback is called more often with smaller chunks.

    * 'nosignal': Tells TclCurl not use any functions that install signal
      handlers or any functions that cause signals to be sent to the process.

  * New command:

    * 'curl::versioninfo': Returns information about various run-time
      features in TclCurl.

  * Bug fixes:

    * Fixed to 'buffer' option to post data.

    * Asif Haswarey reported that '--with-curlinclude' wouldn't work.

    * The multi interface examples suddenly stopped working, they
      should now.

Version 0.9.8 released 25-June-02

  * Support for libcurl's multi interface, the main features are:

    * Enable a "pull" interface. The application that uses TclCurl
      decides where and when to get/send data.

    * Enable multiple simultaneous transfers in the same thread
      without making it complicated for the application.

    * Keep Tk GUIs 'alive' while transfers are taking place.

  * New 'httppost' options

    * 'bufferName' and 'buffer', the contents of buffer will be sent
       to the server as if they were a file whose name is in bufferName,
       please check the 'httpBufferPost.tcl' example.

  * New 'getinfo' options

    * redirectime: Returns the total time, in seconds, it took for all
      redirection steps including name lookup, connect, pretransfer and
      transfer before the final transaction was started, it returns the
      complete execution time for multiple redirections.

    * redirectcount: Returns the total number of redirections that were
      actually followed.

Version 0.9.6 released 30-April-02

  * New configure options:

    * dnscachetimeout, to set the timeout in seconds for keeping the name resolves
      in memory.

    * dnsuseglobalcache, if set to '1' the DNS cache will be shared among
      curl handles.

    * debugproc, to set a procedure that will receive the debug data
      produced by the 'verbose' option.


  * Jonathan Matthew found and fixed a seg fault when you used
    the 'httpheader' option twice with the same handle.


  * The configure scripts saw more work in this release:

    * I merged the latest changes to the TEA sample extension by
      Jeff Hobbs.

    * Suresh K. Sastry found and fixed an incompatibility with Solaris.

    * And I hope I have not forgotten any 'DESTDIR' this time.

Version 0.9.5 released 01-April-2002

  * I have adapted the configure scripts to the new TEA scripts released by
    Jeff Hobbs, for example, now it will compile 'out of the box' for freeBSD
    systems (well, you may need to use '--with-curlprefix' and '--with-curlinclude')

  * New configure option:

    * prequote: use it to pass a list of ftp commands to execute *just before*
      the transfer.

  * New getinfo option:

    * contenttype: if the servers bothers to tell you, this will return the type
      of the downloadad object.

  * Bug fix: 'curl::transfer' will return '0' if the transfer was successful.
                     *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY ***

Version 0.9.3 released 29-Jan-2002

  * Bug fix: There should no more seg faults because of trailing options
    in configure commands.

  * Bug fix: Binary transfer weren't done right in Windows, thanks to
    Peter Waltenberg and Darren Blee for the report.

  * TclCurl now supports OpenSSL engines, which allow you to keep your private
    key stored in external hardware.

        In order to manage this there are a few new configure options:

            * sslcerttype: Set SSL cert type (PEM/DER).

            * sslkey: Set SSL private key (file).

            * sslkeytype: Set SSL key type (PEM/DER/ENG).

            * sslkeypasswd: Set the passphrase for your private key.

            * sslengine: Set the name of the crypto engine.

            * sslenginedefault: Set the default engine.

  * You can now add a set of headers for a particular part in a
    multipart/form-post using the 'contentheader' option.

  * It is now possible to execute commands in ftp servers without
    transfering files, you have to set 'nobody' to '1' and 'header' to
    '0'.
